  -- Make the libflowsource library more tolerant of anticipated
     changes to libfixbuf: Use explicit values for IE lengths.
* rwguess
  -- Deprecate rwguess for removal in SiLK 4.0.0 as its functionality
     can be duplicated by rwpdu2silk and rwuniq.
* configure and building
  -- Fix bugs that would occur when the user specified a "name
     transformation" to configure (e.g., --program-suffix): Perl and
     Python scripts that called other SiLK tools used the
     non-transformed tool name; daemon control scripts used the

     ICMP Code value, respectively.  The icmpTypeCode field is
     deprecated.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: Specifying --values=distinct:icmpTypeCode is no
     longer supported.  As long as the input is limited to ICMP
     records, using --values=distinct:dPort provides an equivalent
     result.
* rwsort enhancement
  -- Add --help-fields switch to print a description of the fields
     that can be used in the --fields switch.
  -- Add new fields iType and iCode that contain the ICMP Type and
     ICMP Code value, respectively.  The icmpTypeCode field is
     deprecated.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The iType and iCode fields pay attention to
     whether the record is ICMP, unlike the icmpTypeCode field.
     Results of --fields=icmpTypeCode will differ between SiLK 3.8.0
     and 3.8.1.

     whether the record is ICMP, unlike the icmpTypeCode field.
     Results of --id-fields=icmpTypeCode will differ between SiLK
     3.8.0 and 3.8.1.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The --delta-field switch no longer accepts
     icmpTypeCode.  As long as the input is limited to ICMP records,
     using --delta-field=dPort will provide an equivalent result.
* rwrecgenerator enhancement
  -- Make textual output switches consistent with rwcut.

  -- Change parsing of (textual) IPv6 address to be more strict (e.g.,
     fix a bug that treated embedded whitespace as a colon).
* rwbagbuild bug fix
  -- Change parsing of (textual) IPv6 address to be more strict (e.g.,
     fix a bug that treated embedded whitespace as a colon).
* rwsettool bug fix
  -- Fix potential memory leak when intersecting IPsets.
* flowcap, rwflowpack changes
  -- Add a missing-ips quirk which allows processing of IPFIX or
     NetFlow v9 records that do not have IP addresses.  This change
     allows one to work-around the change made in SiLK 3.8.0.
  -- Add a firewall-event log-flag which causes messages about ignored
     firewall-event flow records to be logged.
  -- Fix a bug that could cause records received before the second
     receipt of the template to be ignored when using libfixbuf-1.4.0.
* These features are deprecated and will be removed in SiLK 4.0.

     Replace with the stime, dur, and etime fields, respectively.
  -- In rwaddrcount, the --byte-min, --byte-max, --packet-min,
     --packet-max, --rec-min, and --rec-max switches.  Replace with
     the --min-bytes, --max-bytes, --min-packets, --max-packets,
     --min-records, and --max-records, respectively.
  -- In rwstats, the --sip, --dip, --sport, --dport, --protocol,

     firewallEvent or NF_F_FW_EVENT information elements, such as
     those produced by the Cisco ASA.
  -- Pack all records that contain firewallEvent information elements
     when the firewall-event quirk is not set.  Previous releases of
     SiLK would drop all of these records.

  -- Have flowcap exit with an error when the sensor.conf file
     contains any probes that use directory polling.
  -- Have rwflowpack exit with an error when its input-mode is stream
     and the sensor.conf file contains only read-from-file probes.
* Building
  -- Add support for libfixbuf-1.4.0.  Its use is highly recommended.
  -- Remove support for fixbuf releases prior to libfixbuf-1.2.0.
  -- Remove the --enable-asa-zero-packet-hack switch from configure as
     the quirks keyword in sensor.conf now handles this behavior.
  -- Remove libskipfix as a separate library and merge its
     functionality into libflowsource.
  -- Reduce automake requirement to 1.11 and add 1.14 compatibility.

     variable that, when set, is used as the default value for the
     --record-version switch.
  -- In rwsetcat, allow the --network-structure switch to work on
     IPsets that contain IPv6 addresses.
  -- In rwsetcat, when the --network-structure switch includes 'T' in
     its argument, print the total even when the IPset is empty.
  -- Add a new --ip-format switch to rwsetcat that determines how IP
     addresses are printed.  The --integer-ips and --zero-pad-ips
     switches are deprecated.
  -- Have rwsetcat --count-ips return the exact count of IPs for
     IPsets containing IPv6 addresses.  Previously the returned value
     could be less than the exact count due to lack of precision.
  -- Improve the efficiency of the CIDR-block iterator for some
     in-core representations of IPsets.
  -- Do a better job of reporting errors caused by problems reading or
     writing IPset files.

     its argument, print the total even when the Bag is empty.
  -- Add a new --key-format switch to rwbagcat that determines how
     keys are printed.  The --integer-keys and --zero-pad-ips switches
     are deprecated.
  -- Change the data structure used in memory to represent Bags
     containing IPv6 addresses.  This structure can hold more entries
     at the cost of slower access.
  -- Do a better job of reporting errors caused by problems reading or
     writing Bag files.
* rwfilter enhancements
  -- Add switch --any-index to match either the SNMP input or SNMP
     output interface.
  -- Add switch --any-cc to match either the country code of the
     source address or of the destination address.
* rwaddrcount, rwcut, rwpmapcat, rwpmaplookup, rwstats, rwuniq change
  -- Add a new --ip-format switch that determines how IP addresses are
     printed.  The --integer-ips and --zero-pad-ips switches are
     deprecated.
* rwflowpack changes
  -- Create a manual page for each packing-logic plug-in.
  -- Fix a bug that caused attempted use of the --packing-logic switch
     to always report an error.
  -- Log additional information when an out-of-sequence NetFlow v5
     packet is received.
* flowcap change
  -- Log additional information when an out-of-sequence NetFlow v5
     packet is received.
* libskipfix change
  -- Change processing of bidirectional records to use the reverse TCP
     flags if those elements are present in the template.  In
     SiLK-3.6, those elements were ignored when their value was 0.
* rwreceiver bug fix
  -- Fix a bug in the init.d script.


SiLK-3.6.1 Release, 2013-Apr-23

  -- Change the library to use the SiLK-2.x representation of IPsets
     when the IPset contains only IPv4 addresses.
  -- Continue to use the SiLK-3.x representation for IPsets containing
     IPv6 addresses.
  -- Change the tools that write IPsets to use the SiLK-2.x format for
     IPv4 IPsets and the SiLK-3.x representation for IPv6 IPsets.
  -- Add '0' as an argument to --record-version meaning 'default',
     which is the SiLK-2.x file format for IPv4-only IPsets and the
     SiLK-3.x format for IPsets containing IPv6 addresses.
  -- Accept '3' an an argument to --record-version to force writing an
     IPv4 IPset in the SiLK-3.x format.
* PySiLK changes
  -- Add methods RWRec.is_icmp(), RWRec.is_ipv6(), RWRec.to_ipv4(),
     RWRec.to_ipv6().
  -- Recognize an RWRec containing an IPv6 address and having a
     protocol of 58 as ICMPv6.
  -- Limit the range of times that RWRec.stime, RWRec.duration, and
     RWRec.etime support.
  -- Document the IPSet.isdisjoint() function.
  -- Fix a bug in IPSet.isdisjoint() when comparing an IPv4 IPset with
     an IPv6 IPset.
  -- Fix a bug when setting RWRec.timeout_killed,
     RWRec.timeout_started, and RWRec.uniform_packets.
  -- Fix a bug that allowed setting arbitrary attributes on an RWRec.
  -- Reflect changes to RWRec.initial_flags or RWRec.session_flags in
     RWRec.tcpflags and vice versa.
  -- Clear RWRec.initial_flags and RWRec.session_flags when changing
     RWRec.protocol to a value other than TCP.
  -- Throw an error when attempting to set RWRec.initial_flags or
     RWRec.session_flags on an RWRec where the protocol is not TCP.

* rwrecgenerator
  -- New tool
  -- Use a pseudo-random number generator to create SiLK Flow records
     that can be used to test SiLK applications.
* rwdedupe enhancement
  -- Add support for writing annotations into the header of the output
     file (i.e., support for --note-add, --note-file-add).
  -- Copy annotations and invocation history from the headers of the
     input files to the header of the output file.
* rwuniq bug fix
  -- Fix an issue when using multiple key fields that included
     icmpTypeCode but did not include dPort.  The bug would cause
     non-ICMP records that were were identical in all key fields but
     whose dPort fields were different to be put into different bins.
* rwstats bug fix
  -- Fix an issue when using multiple key fields that included
     icmpTypeCode but did not include dPort.  The bug would cause
     non-ICMP records that were were identical in all key fields but
     whose dPort fields were different to be put into different bins.
* rwflowpack changes
  -- Add a new output-mode "incremental-files" which is similar to
     the "sending" output-mode except it leaves the incremental files
     in the incremental-directory.
  -- Create incremental files as a pair of files: a 0-byte placeholder
     file and a dot-file where records are initially written.
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: If incremental files from a previous
     releases of SiLK are in the incremental-directory when this
     release of rwflowpack is started in the sending output-mode, the
     files will not be moved to the sender-directory.
  -- Deprecate the "sending" output-mode, but continue to accept it
     for backwards compatibility.
  -- Keep the list of incremental files in memory instead of reading
     the file names from the directory.  Do not hold the global write
     lock while moving incremental files to their final destination.
  -- Change the rwflowpack.conf file and associated init.d script for
     compatibility with the above change.
  -- Fix a potential race condition between opening a file and getting
     the write lock on the file.
  -- Add support for reading TCP flags in a subTemplateMultiList as
     exported in IPFIX records created by yaf-2.0.
  -- Add support for logging number of missing NetFlow v9 packets

     are ignored--for example, records that represent firewall events.
  -- Accept NF_F_FWD_FLOW_DELTA_BYTES and NF_F_REV_FLOW_DELTA_BYTES
     as volume values for NetFlow v9 flow records.
  -- Accept initiatorOctets, initiatorPackets, responderOctets, and
     responderPackets as volume values for IPFIX flow records.

     when the protocol is not TCP.
  -- Fix a bug where rwflowpack would abort if the first IPFIX/NetFlow
     v9 record it received contained an unknown options template.
  -- Fix a bug where a disconnect by a UDP IPFIX/NetFlow v9 connection
     was not handled correctly and could cause memory corruption.
  -- Fix a bug where future-dated records could be created when the
     NetFlow v9 sysUptime rolled over.
  -- Make small changes to log messages.
  -- Add the --log-post-rotate switch to control post-processing of
     the previous day's log file.
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY. Exit with an error when the argument
     to --post-command contains any unknown '%'-conversions.
  -- Update documentation.
* flowcap enhancement
  -- Add support for reading TCP flags in a subTemplateMultiList as
     exported in IPFIX records created by yaf-2.0.
  -- Add support for logging number of missing NetFlow v9 packets
     (requires libfixbuf-1.3.0 or later).
  -- Write messages to the log file for IPFIX/NetFlow v9 records that
     are ignored--for example, records that represent firewall events.

     when the protocol is not TCP.
  -- Fix a bug where flowcap would abort if the first IPFIX/NetFlow
     v9 record it received contained an unknown options template.
  -- Fix a bug where a disconnect by a UDP IPFIX/NetFlow v9 connection
     was not handled correctly and could cause memory corruption.
  -- Fix a bug where future-dated records could be created when the
     NetFlow v9 sysUptime rolled over.
  -- Make small changes to log messages.
  -- Add the --log-post-rotate switch to control post-processing of
     the previous day's log file.
* rwreceiver changes
  -- Add ability to monitor disk usage when either --freespace-minimum
     or --space-maximum-percent is specified.
  -- Add the --unique-duplicates switch to create a complete copy of
     files (as opposed to using hard links) when creating duplicates
     via the --duplicate-destination switch.
  -- Fix a potential bug in TLS connections where attempting to read

     files (as opposed to using hard links) when creating duplicates
     of the incoming files via the --local-directory switch.
  -- Add the --log-post-rotate switch to control post-processing of

     the previous day's log file.
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY. Exit with an error when the argument
     to --post-command or --hour-file-command contains any unknown
     '%'-conversions.
* rwpollexec changes
  -- Fix an issue where the stdout and stderr from the command would
     not appear in the log file after the log file had been rotated.
  -- Add the --log-post-rotate switch to control post-processing of
     the previous day's log file.
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY. Exit with an error when the argument
     to --command contains any unknown '%'-conversions.
* libsilk change
  -- When reading SiLK Flow records, ensure that the initialFlags and
     sessionFlags values are 0 for records that are not TCP, ignoring
     any value stored in the file.
  -- When writing SiLK Flow records, always store the attributes value
     (if the file format supports it).  Previously, some very old file
     formats only stored attributes when the protocol was TCP.
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY. Exit with an error when the
     path-format in silk.conf contains any unknown '%'-conversions.
* Building changes
  -- Require automake 1.12 or later to rebuild the Makefile.in files.

SiLK-3.5.1 Release, 2012-Dec-20

* IPset bug fix
  -- Fix a bug that made it impossible to save very large IPset files.
* rwsiteinfo changes
  -- Change the output to print rows that have some empty fields.  For
     example, previously --fields=sensor,class would print a sensor
     only if it was assigned to a class.  Now all sensors are printed.
  -- Treat the default-class field as all other fields are handled.
  -- Fix a bug where restrictions specified by --flowtypes, --classes,
     --types, and --sensors were not being applied across all fields.
* PySiLK bug fix
  -- Fix a bug in reporting the cardinality of IPSets that contain
     more than 2^63-1 addresses.
* rwfilter bug fix
  -- Fix a bug during parsing the silk.conf file that prevented
     putting a sensorgroup into another sensorgroup.
  -- Alter error messages printed when the parsing of silk.conf fails.
* rwsender, rwreceiver bug fixes
  -- Fix a bug when reading data that could cause rwsender or
     rwreceiver to close a valid connection.
  -- Fix a crash that could occur on the server-side when the server
     rejects a client due to the client having an invalid identifier.
  -- Slow how quickly a client reconnects to a server when the
     server rejects the client due to unrecognized identifier.


SiLK-3.5.0 Release, 2012-Nov-01

* Country Codes enhancement
  -- Modify the country code library so it supports IPv6 addresses.
  -- Add new --v6-csv-input switch to rwgeoip2ccmap to support
     building a country code prefix map that contains IPv6 addresses.
  -- NOTE: Previous releases of SiLK are unable to read the IPv6
     country code file.
* rwflowappend change
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: Modify rwflowappend to use the packed
     file information in a file's header instead of relying on the
     name of the file.  The file name will only be checked if the file
     does not contain the necessary header.
* rwreceiver, rwsender bug fix
  -- Fix a bug when reading data that could cause rwsender or
     rwreceiver to close a valid connection.
* rwfilter bug fix
  -- Fix a bug where two binary streams could be written to the
     standard output by using "stdout" for one and "-" for the other.
  -- Fix a bug where --pass-destination or --fail-destination could be
     used without partitioning rules when --all-destination was given.
* rwcut bug fix
  -- Fix a bug where the --num-recs switch was not being handled
     properly when there were multiple input files.
* rwstats bug fix
  -- Fix a bug that prevented counting distinct values originating
     from a plug-in when the key contained a field from a plug-in.
* rwuniq bug fix
  -- Fix a bug that prevented counting distinct values originating
     from a plug-in when the key contained a field from a plug-in.
* rwpmatch bug fix
  -- Fix a bug where "stdin" and "-" were treated as separate input
     streams instead of as aliases.
* libsilk bug fixes
  -- Fix a bug in LZO decompression on 32 bit platforms that could
     cause memory corruption.
  -- When parsing silk.conf, ensure that the names of classes, types,
     and sensors are of legal length and do not contain invalid
     characters.
* PySiLK change
  -- Throw an exception when an attempt is make to pickle or unpickle
     silk objects.  Previously, attempts to pickle or unpickle these
     objects could cause the application to crash.


SiLK-3.4.1 Release, 2012-Sep-27

* rwcut enhancement
  -- Add new --tail-recs switch to print some number of records at the
     end of a file or an input stream.
* rwflowpack, flowcap bug fix
  -- Fix an issue where receiving incorrect data from a previously
     rejected UDP client could cause the application to exit.
* silk.magic
  -- Include a sample "magic" file for use with the UNIX file utility.
     The file is installed in share/silk/silk.magic.


SiLK-3.4.0 Release, 2012-Sep-13

* Change across all tools
  -- Modify processing of some ICMP SiLK Flow records.  ICMP type and
     code are normally encoded in the destination port.  Due to a bug
     when processing IPFIX bi-flow ICMP records, the type and code
     were sometimes stored in the source port.  SiLK-3.4.0 attempts to
     fix this bad encoding.  However, this change removes a previous
     work-around designed to fix issues with SiLK Flow records
     collected prior to SiLK-0.8.0 that originated as NetFlow v5 PDUs
     from some types of Cisco routers.
* rwsetcat change
  -- Print the IPset file name when either --print-statistics or
     --count-ips is used and multiple files appear on command line.
  -- Add new switch --print-filenames which can explicitly enable or
     suppress printing of the IPset file name.
* rwsetmember change
  -- Process all files specified on the command line despite being
     unable to read some files.
* rwscan change
  -- Provide new --trw-internal-set switch that implements the
     behavior of the --trw-sip-set switch, and mark the latter as
     deprecated.
  -- Generate an error when multiple internal IPsets are specified.
* rwpmaplookup changes
  -- Change the width of the column that contains the value (i.e., the
     label) from 20 characters to width of the longest label.
  -- Fix a display issue where labels longer than 45 characters were
     being truncated.
* rwuniq bug fixes
  -- Fix a bug where the --bin-time value was not being applied to the
     eTime field unless the key fields included sTime and dur as well.
  -- Fix a crash that could occur when using more than eight fields
     and some the fields were defined by plug-ins.
  -- Fix a display issue where prefix map labels longer than 128
     characters were being truncated.
* rwstats bug fixes
  -- Fix a bug where the --bin-time value was not being applied to the
     eTime field unless the key fields included sTime and dur as well.
  -- Fix a crash that could occur when using more than eight fields
     and some the fields were defined by plug-ins.
  -- Fix a display issue where prefix map labels longer than 128
     characters were being truncated.
* rwcut bug fix
  -- Fix a display issue where prefix map labels longer than 128
     characters were being truncated.
* rwipfix2silk bug fix
  -- Fix a bug when processing IPFIX bi-flow ICMP records that caused
     the Type and Code to be recorded incorrectly.
* rwflowpack, flowcap changes
  -- Allow multiple NetFlow v9 or IPFIX-over-UDP sources to connect
     to the same source port.  (Requires libfixbuf-1.2.0 or later.)
  -- Require libfixbuf-1.1.0 or newer for supporting collection of
     NetFlow v9 flow records.
  -- Add the --no-chdir switch which prevents the daemon from changing
     directory to / on start-up.
  -- Change how statistics received from yaf are logged, and include
     additional statistics in the log message.
  -- Suppress printing of yaf statistics until a statistics message is
     received.
  -- Fix a bug when processing IPFIX bi-flow ICMP records that caused
     the Type and Code to be recorded incorrectly.
* rwreceiver, rwsender changes
  -- Add the --no-chdir switch which prevents the daemon from changing
     directory to / on start-up.
* rwflowappend change
  -- Add the --no-chdir switch which prevents the daemon from changing
     directory to / on start-up.
* rwpollexec change
  -- Add the --no-chdir switch which prevents the daemon from changing
     directory to / on start-up.
* Building
  -- Add new configure switch --disable-silk3-ipsets.  When specified,
     SiLK is built with the IPset code as it existed in SiLK-2 (which
     means IPsets will be unable to store IPv6 addresses).  Use of
     this switch may give worse or better performance depending on the
     types of IPsets used.
  -- Add new configure switch --enable-asa-zero-packet-hack to work
     around a bug in the NetFlow9 template used by Cisco ASA routers
     wherein the template is missing a packetTotalCount field, causing
     rwflowpack to treat these flows as having 0 packets. When the
     switch is specified, SiLK sets the packet count to 1 for flow
     records having a source IP, a byte count, but no packet count.
     In addition, if SiLK is compiled without IPv6 support, the hack
     causes rwflowpack to a use fully-expanded file format to store
     IPv4 flow records collected from netflow-v9 probes.


SiLK-3.3.4 Release, 2012-Aug-01

* rwscanquery bug fix
  -- Fix a bug where rwscanquery would attempt to create a file whose
     name started and ended with a quote character.
* rwsender changes
  -- Fix an issue where rwsender may hang or crash while it attempts
     to exit after encountering an unexpected condition.
  -- Properly handle the case where a message is only partially
     written to a socket.
  -- Make some internal changes to how GnuTLS connections are handled.
  -- Make changes to some log messages.
* rwreceiver changes
  -- Make some internal changes to how GnuTLS connections are handled.
  -- Make changes in how rwreceiver reads messages so that when data
     is available, rwreceiver reads all of the data.
  -- Make changes to some log messages.


SiLK-3.3.3 Release, 2012-Jul-19

* flowcap, rwflowappend, rwflowpack, rwpollexec, rwreceiver, rwsender
  -- Fix an issue with log file locking that may cause an application
     to hang or crash when it attempts to rotate the daily log file.


SiLK-3.3.2 Release, 2012-Jul-12

* IPset bug fix
  -- Fix a bug in the libsilk function that performs IPset difference.
     The bug could cause rwsettool to create a corrupt IPset file
     which is unreadable by other applications.
* Bag bug fixes
  -- Fix a bug in the Bag iterator function when using a key that was
     smaller than four octets.  The bug caused the iterator to visit
     the entries in the bag multiple times.
  -- Fix a bug in the Bag iterator function when iterating over an
     empty Bag where the key was one octet.  The bug caused the
     application to crash.
* rwsetcat change
  -- Modify --print-statistics so output is generated when the IPset
     is empty.  Previously, no output was generated.
* rwsettool change
  -- Do not copy the invocation history from the input IPset files to
     the output IPset file.


SiLK-3.3.0 Release, 2012-Jun-14

* IPset bug fixes
  -- Important Bug Fixes.
  -- Fix bugs in the libsilk functions that perform IPset union,
     intersect, and difference operations.  These bugs could cause
     IPset applications (e.g., rwsettool) to produce incorrect output
     or to exit unexpectedly.
  -- Modify the skIPSetIterateBind() and skIPSetWalk() functions to
     use the ipv6-policy parameter.
* rwstats bug fixes
  -- Fix bugs that could cause an expected exit when rwstats was
     unable to hold all of its data in memory.
  -- Fix a bug in computing --values=distinct:KEY when the KEY is an
     IP address field and rwstats is processing IPv6 flow records.
* rwuniq bug fixes
  -- Fix bugs that could cause an expected exit when rwuniq was unable
     to hold all of its data in memory.
  -- Fix a bug in computing --values=distinct:KEY when the KEY is an
     IP address field and rwuniq is processing IPv6 flow records.
* rwsort changes
  -- Internal changes that may speed merging of temporary files.
  -- Print an error message when rwsort fails to write records to a
     temporary file.
* rwdedupe bug fix
  -- Print an error message when rwdedupe fails to write records to a
     temporary file.
* rwflowpack changes
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: The internal identifiers for probe
     types have changed.  All packing logic plug-ins must be
     recompiled.
  -- When --pack-interfaces is specified, use the smallest file format
     that is large enough to hold the additional fields.
  -- Fix a potential crash and/or deadlock when reading NetFlow v5
     PDUs over the network.
  -- Modify the log messages produced by libfixbuf to follow the
     format of other rwflowpack log messages.
* rwscanquery changes
  -- Allow use of both --daddress and --dipset for the scanset report.
  -- Perform more robust parsing of IP addresses specified by the
     --saddress switch.
  -- Write verbose output to standard error instead of to standard out.
  -- Fix a bug in date parsing where the value specified by --end-date
     was sometimes ignored.
* flowcap changes
  -- Print a log message that specifies the number of packets received
     when closing an empty file.  Previously, the message was only
     printed when closing a file that contained records.
  -- Add a log message documenting the number of flow records
     processed and ignored when closing files based on IPFIX or
     NetFlow v9 probes.
  -- Fix a deadlock that would occur during shutdown after certain fatal
     error conditions were detected.
  -- Fix a potential crash and/or deadlock when reading NetFlow v5
     PDUs over the network.
  -- Modify the log messages produced by libfixbuf to follow the
     format of other flowcap log messages.
* rwsender, rwreceiver bug fix

     1 when it was unable to read the first IPset file.


SiLK-3.2.0 Release, 2012-Mar-20

* PySiLK bug fixes
  -- Fix a bug when coercing IPv6 bags to a have a 4 byte key.
  -- Add the documented but unimplemented key_type argument to
     Bag_load(), and fix bugs in the deprecated Bag.load_ipaddr() and
     Bag.load_integer() functions.
  -- Fix an issue where some functions in the silk.site module failed
     to call init_site(), contrary to the documented behavior.
  -- Fix a bug that prevented use of silk.site.sensor_description().

     count of the files.
* rwreceiver bug fix
  -- Handle the case where rwreceiver attempts to receive files with
     the same name from multiple rwsender processes simultaneously.
  -- Stop transferring the current file when a critical error occurs.
* rwgeoip2ccmap change
  -- Update the country code array used when parsing binary MaxMind
     data to be consistent with GeoIP C API 1.4.8 of 2011-06-24.
* Building
  -- Fix a minor bug in generating the names of manual pages.
  -- Support a static packing logic file when building an RPM.


SiLK-3.1.0 Release, 2012-Feb-15

* rwset enhancement
  -- Add support for the --ipv6-policy switch.
* rwbag enhancement
  -- Add support for the --ipv6-policy switch.
* rwipfix2silk change
  -- Ignore IPFIX records that have a packet or byte count of zero.
* rwsender, rwreceiver enhancement
  -- Add support for GnuTLS 3.x.
  -- Fix a potential deadlock during shutdown.
* flowcap changes
  -- Ignore return codes from libfixbuf that indicate it received a
     NetFlow v9 element it did not understand.

  -- Fix an issue when multiple NetFlow v5 sources attempted to listen
     on the same port.
  -- Improvements and changes to log messages.
* rwflowpack changes
  -- Allow for categorizing flow records solely based on VLAN tags.
     To support this change, the sensor.conf file allows multiple
     blocks for the same sensor to use the same probe.
  -- Fix an issue when processing IPFIX files where the file was never
     closed.  This could cause rwflowpack to exit unexpectedly once it
     ran out of file handles.
  -- Fix a crash that would occur at start-up when a NetFlow v5 reader
     failed to bind to a port.
  -- Ignore return codes from libfixbuf that indicate it received a
     NetFlow v9 element it did not understand.
  -- Ignore IPFIX records that have a packet or byte count of zero.
  -- Fix an issue of having multiple NetFlow v5 sources listen on the
     same port.
  -- Improvements and changes to log messages.
* rwflowappend change
  -- Use advisory write locks on files in the repository to avoid
     conflicts when multiple rwflowappend processes attempt to write
     to the same hourly file.
  -- The new switch --no-file-locking can be used to disable these
     advisory locks.
* rwpollexec change
  -- On systems where "/bin/sh -c" does not use exec, attempt to find
     a shell that does use exec.
* rwfilter change
  -- rwfilter now exits with status 0 if there is a problem opening or
     reading an input flow file.  Previously, its exit status was 1.

     corrupted compressed block that caused rwfileinfo to report fewer
     valid records than actually existed.
* rwpdedupe bug fix
  -- Fix fatal error.
* rwpmaplookup bug fix
  -- Fix a fatal error that would occur if the --map-file was invalid.
* Building
  -- Modify the expected result of some tests run with "make check"
     when standard input is not a terminal.
  -- Fix a configuration issue when testing for Python on Ubuntu.


SiLK-3.0.0 Release, 2011-Sep-30

* IPsets support IPv6 addresses
  -- In a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, IPv4 addresses are stored
     in the ::ffff:0:0/96 prefix.
  -- rwset and rwsetbuild create IPsets that contain IPv6 addresses.
  -- rwsettool manipulates IPsets containing IPv6 addresses.
  -- rwsetcat prints IPsets containing IPv6 addresses, though the
     --network-structure only supports IPv4 currently.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: By default, rwset, rwsetbuild, and rwsettool
     create IPsets that are incompatible with SiLK-2.x unless the
     --record-version=2 switch is specified.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The legacy IPset tools rwsetunion and
     rwsetintersect have been removed.  Use rwsettool instead.
* rwset enhancement
  -- The newly added --any-set switch creates a IPset containing both
     the source and destination IP addresses on the SiLK Flow records.
* rwsetcat change
  -- The --cidr-blocks switch now accepts an optional argument.
* Bags support IPv6 addresses
  -- In a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, IPv4 addresses are stored
     in the ::ffff:0:0/96 prefix.
  -- rwbag and rwbagbuild create bags that contain IPv6 addresses.
  -- rwbagtool manipulates IPsets containing IPv6 addresses.
  -- rwsetcat prints bags containing IPv6 addresses, though the
     --network-structure only supports IPv4 currently.
  -- Bag files now record the type of the key and counter when the Bag
     is created.
  -- Bag files that contain IPv4 addresses are readable by SiLK-2.x.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The maximum counter value supported by bag files
     has been reduced by 1, to 2^64 - 2.
* rwbagbuild change
  -- The new --key-type and --counter-type switches allow the type of
     the key and counter to be specified when the bag is created.
* rwbag changes
  -- rwbag no longer stops processing records when an overflow occurs
     for a particular key.  Instead, rwbag sets that key's counter to
     the maximum value and continues.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: Deprecated switches (e.g., --sf-file) have been
     removed, as well as the --legacy-help switch.
* rwbagcat change
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The --stats and --tree-stats switches have been
     removed and replaced by the new switch --print-statistics.
* Prefix maps support IPv6 addresses
  -- rwpmapbuild creates prefix maps that contain IPv6 addresses.
  -- rwpmapcat prints prefix maps that contain IPv6 addresses.
* rwpmapbuild enhancements
  -- There is better support for prefix maps that use numbers as
     labels.
  -- Performance is hugely improved when building very large prefix
     maps.
  -- The new --dry-run switch checks the syntax of the file without
     building the prefix map.
  -- The new --ignore-errors switch causes rwpmapbuild to write the
     output despite errors in the input.
* rwpmaplookup
  -- New tool
  -- rwpmaplookup finds information about specific IP address(es) or
     protocol/port pair(s) in a binary prefix map file and prints the
     result as text.
  -- This tool is an expanded version of rwip2cc, which is now
     deprecated.
* rwsiteinfo
  -- New tool
  -- rwsiteinfo prints information about the sensors, classes, and
     types specified in the silk.conf site configure file.
  -- This tool is an expanded version of mapsid, which is now
     deprecated.
* int-ext-fields.so
  -- New plug-in for rwcut, rwgroup, rwsort, rwstats, and rwuniq.
  -- The int-ext-fields plug-in defines fields (int-ip, ext-ip,
     int-port, ext-port) which can be used to print, sort by, or group
     by the internal or external IP or port.  This plug-in is useful
     when a single flow file contains flows in multiple directions.
* PySiLK enhancements
  -- Support for Python 3.x has been added.
  -- Support for Python 2.4 and 2.5 is now considered frozen.
  -- There are numerous changes to support the IPv6 capability in
     IPsets and bags.
  -- The silk.site class has many changes, especially regarding the
     reading of the silk.conf file.
  -- Three new methods in silk.site class---repository_iter(),
     repository_silkfile_iter(), and repository_full_iter()---are
     provided to iterate over files in the data repository.  Their use
     is recommended over the FGlob class.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The key_type attribute on Bag objects has been
     removed.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: When creating PySiLK plug-ins, any filters must
     be registered by calling register_filter().  Previously, PySiLK
     would automatically register a filter.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: When creating PySiLK plug-ins, fields must be
     registered with register_field().  The legacy method
     register_plugin_field() has been removed.
* Changes across many analysis tools
  -- Almost all analysis tools now accept the --xargs switch to read
     the list of names of files to process from the standard input or
     a file.
  -- A new switch --timestamp-format provides more control over how
     timestamps are printed.  The --epoch-time and --legacy-timestamp
     switches are now deprecated.
  -- A new value for 'attribute' is available.  The attribute 'S' is
     set when the flow generator notices that all packets in the flow
     are the same size.
  -- The key field 'dur' has been renamed to 'duration'.  Most uses
     will be unaffected by this change, but there is a POTENTIAL
     INCOMPATIBILITY if a user-defined plug-in defines a key field
     named 'duration' or with a similar prefix.
  -- Binary output to a pipe is no longer compressed by default, which
     provides increased throughput when piping data between SiLK
     applications.
  -- Almost all tools support the SILK_CLOBBER environment variable.
     When this variable is set, SiLK allows new output files to
     overwrite existing files.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: When the --no-columns switch is specified,
     fields containing TCP flags and attributes are printed without
     embedded spaces.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The --dynamic-library switch has been removed,
     as well as support for the old dynlib API.  Applications must use
     the --plugin switch and skplugin API.
  -- Tools affected by one or more of these changes are rwaddrcount,
     rwbag, rwbagbuild, rwbagcat, rwbagtool, rwcat, rwcount, rwcut,
     rwdedupe, rwfilter, rwgroup, rwip2cc, rwipaexport, rwipfix2silk,
     rwmatch, rwnetmask, rwpackchecker, rwptoflow, rwrandomizeip,
     rwscan, rwset, rwsetbuild, rwsettool, rwsilk2ipfix, rwsort,
     rwsplit, rwstats, rwtotal, rwtuc, rwuniq
* rwcount enhancements
  -- New --load-scheme=5 computes the maximum possible values for each
     bin, as if the entire flow record had occurred in that bin.
  -- New --load-scheme=6 computes the minimum possible values for each
     bin, as if the entire flow record had occurred in some other bin,
     for records that span multiple bins.
* rwuniq enhancements
  -- Support added for counting the number of distinct values of
     almost any field.
  -- The value 'flows' is now provided as an alias for 'records'.
* rwstats enhancements
  -- Support added for counting the number of distinct values of
     almost any field.
  -- The key 'dur' has been renamed to 'duration'.
  -- The value 'flows' is now provided as an alias for 'records'.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: Deprecated switches (e.g., --sip-topn) have been
     removed.
* rwresolve enhancements
  -- Support has been added for IPv6 addresses.
  -- rwresolve defaults to using the C-ares asynchronous resolving
     library, if that library was found during compilation.
* rwfilter changes
  -- Better support when writing to a pipe and a file or another pipe
     simultaneously.  Specifically, rwfilter used to exit when any
     pipe stopped receiving data.  Now, rwfilter will finish writing
     the output to the file or other pipe when one pipe closes.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The deprecated --ipport-* and --ippair-*
     switches have been removed.  Use the --tuple-* family of switches
     instead.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The argument to --xargs is now optional.  As a
     result, any use of "--xargs <file>" must be changed to
     --xargs=<file>.
* rwcat enhancements
  -- Support for putting annotations in the header of the output file
     has been added (i.e., support for --note-add, --note-file-add).
* rwmatch enhancement
  -- Support for putting annotations in the header of the output file
     has been added (i.e., support for --note-add, --note-file-add).
  -- Support for setting the compression of the output file.
* rwfileinfo enhancements
  -- New --field=16 prints information about an IPset file.
  -- New --field=17 prints information about a bag file.
* rwsort change
  -- Internal changes that may affect the order of records that have
     the same key.
* rwpdu2silk
  -- New tool
  -- rwpdu2silk reads files containing NetFlow v5 records and writes
     a stream of SiLK Flow records.
* rwipfix2silk, rwsilk2ipfix change
  -- These tools are only built when the configure script finds
     libfixbuf-1.0.0 or later.
* Deprecated tools
  -- rwip2cc is deprecated.  Use rwpmaplookup instead.
  -- mapsid is deprecated.  Use rwsiteinfo instead.
* rwflowpack, flowcap enhancements
  -- rwflowpack and flowcap only support IPFIX (and NetFlow v9) when
     libfixbuf-1.0.0 or later is available.
  -- A single IPFIX probe listening on a TCP port will accept
     connections from multiple IPFIX clients.
  -- An IPFIX probe can specify the name or address of a single host
     that is allowed to connect.
  -- Multiple IPFIX probes can listen on the same TCP port.  Listening
     on a single UDP port for multiple IPFIX probes is not permitted.
  -- rwflowpack and flowcap properly handle status messages from yaf
     and write a message to the log file.
  -- rwflowpack and flowcap support listening for flow records on IPv6
     addresses.
  -- The sensor.conf file accepts a host name as a valid address to
     listen as or to accept a connection from.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: Parsing of the sensor.conf file is more strict.
     Some statements that previous versions of SiLK used to ignore
     will now cause errors.
  -- rwflowpack now writes log messages about missing NetFlow v5
     records when reading PDUs from a file.
* rwsender, rwreceiver enhancements
  -- rwsender and rwreceiver support communicating over IPv6
     addresses.
  -- When running in server mode, rwsender and rwreceiver support
     binding to a particular IP address on multi-homed machines.
* Numerous changes to C functions in libraries.
  -- Support for dynlib API has been removed.  Use the skplugin API
     instead.
  -- The iochecks.h header has been deleted.
  -- Functions for skipaddr_t have been moved into skipaddr.h, which
     you may need to include.
  -- The bag API has been largely rewritten, and the old API is
     deprecated.
  -- Many deprecated functions have been removed.
  -- Many additional changes.


SiLK-2.5.0 Release, 2012-Jun-28

* rwflowpack change
  -- Modify the log messages produced by libfixbuf to follow the
     format of other rwflowpack log messages.
  -- Modify NetFlow v9 support to require libfixbuf-1.1.0.
* flowcap change
  -- Modify the log messages produced by libfixbuf to follow the
     format of other rwflowpack log messages.
  -- Modify NetFlow v9 support to require libfixbuf-1.1.0.
* Building
  -- Add new configure switch --enable-asa-zero-packet-hack to work
     around a bug in the NetFlow9 template used by Cisco ASA routers
     wherein the template is missing a packetTotalCount field, causing
     rwflowpack to treat these flows as having 0 packets. When the
     switch is specified, SiLK sets the packet count to 1 for flow
     records having a source IP, a byte count, but no packet count.
     In addition, if SiLK is compiled without IPv6 support, the hack
     causes rwflowpack to a use fully-expanded file format to store
     IPv4 flow records collected from netflow-v9 probes.


SiLK-2.4.7 Release, 2012-Feb-15

* rwfilter enhancement
  -- Better support when writing to a pipe and a file or another pipe
     simultaneously.  Specifically, rwfilter used to exit when any
     pipe stopped receiving data.  Now, rwfilter will finish writing
     the output to the file or other pipe when one pipe closes.
* rwset bug fix
  -- Ignore IPv6 flow records.
* rwipfix2silk changes
  -- Ignore IPFIX records that have a packet or byte count of zero.
  -- Fix an issue where rwipfix2silk did not free the memory for the
     current input file before opening the next file.

  -- Provide better error messages when the user provides the wrong
     input switch to the program.
  -- When processing binary input, tell the user about any
     unrecognized values.
  -- Verify that the resulting prefix map is valid before writing the
     map to the output.
* rwpmapbuild enhancement
  -- Performance is hugely improved when building very large prefix
     maps.
* rwfileinfo bug fix
  -- Fix an issue when processing a compressed file containing a
     corrupted compressed block that caused rwfileinfo to report fewer
     valid records than actually existed.

  -- Fix an issue when processing IPFIX files where the file was never
     closed.  This could cause rwflowpack to exit unexpectedly once it
     ran out of file handles.
  -- Ignore return codes from libfixbuf that indicate it received a
     NetFlow v9 element it did not understand.
  -- Ignore IPFIX records that have a packet or byte count of zero.
  -- Ignore IPFIX records from yaf marked as "udp-uniflow".
* flowcap bug fix
  -- Ignore return codes from libfixbuf that indicate it received a
     NetFlow v9 element it did not understand.
  -- Ignore IPFIX records that have a packet or byte count of zero.
  -- Ignore IPFIX records from yaf marked as "udp-uniflow".
* PySiLK change
  -- Add a constant containing the maximum bag counter value.
* rwpdedupe bug fix
  -- Fix fatal error.
* Building
  -- Modify the expected result of some tests run with "make check"
     when standard input is not a terminal.
  -- Fix a configuration issue when testing for Python on Ubuntu.
* rwsetunion, rwsetintersect
  -- Mark these applications as deprecated. Use rwsettool instead.


SiLK-2.4.5 Release, 2011-Feb-25

* flowcap, rwflowpack
  -- Modify NetFlow v5 collection to handle changes in sequence number
     due to router reboots and sequence number roll-overs.
  -- Change how missing NetFlow records are reported.
  -- Fix potential deadlock that can occur when buffer holding packets
     to process fills to capacity.
* rwflowpack
  -- For netflow-v5 probes, always use the 'log-flags' setting from
     sensor.conf regardless of source of the records.
* rwbag
  -- Stop processing input once memory is exhausted.
* rwfilter
  -- Manual page enhancements.


SiLK-2.4.4 Release, 2011-Jan-13

* rwcut, rwuniq, rwstats
  -- Add a new --integer-tcp-flags switch that prints the TCP flag
     fields as an integer value instead of characters.
* rwtuc
  -- Provide the --verbose and --stop-on-error switches that report
     why a field failed to parse.
* rwfilter, ipafilter.so
  -- Fix a bug where the ipafilter.so plug-in prevented rwfilter from
     using multiple threads, even when ipafilter was not active.
* rwp2yaf2silk
  -- Add a --version switch.
* Manual page updates in several tools.
* Configuring/Building
  -- Have "make" create Perl and Python scripts from .in files using
     the paths to Perl and Python found by configure.


SiLK-2.4.2 Release, 2010-Dec-01

* rwfilter, ipafilter.so
  -- Fix an issue where rwfilter attempted to initialize ipafilter on
     every invocation, even when IPA-related switches were not given.
     This prevented rwfilter from running when SiLK was built with IPA
     support but run-time support for IPA was not configured.
* flowcap

* rwpmapcat
  -- Fix bug where final newline would not be printed for some types
     of output.
* rwfileinfo
  -- Fix floating point exception when attempting to print record
     counts for very old SiLK files.
* rwpollexec
  -- Fix unexpected exit that would occur when rwpollexec was run
     without an archive-directory.
  -- Modify rwpollexec so it no longer exits when there is a problem
     archiving a file or moving it to the error-directory.
* Configuring/Building
  -- Fix issue that prevented building with static packing logic.


SiLK-2.4.0 Release, 2010-Sep-30

* rwuniq
  -- Change the hashing function used internally.  This may affect the
     order in which bins are printed for unsorted output.
  -- Fix a bug in --sorted-output that caused the sort order to always
     consider start-time and plug-in fields after all other fields,
     regardless of order they appeared in the --fields switch.
  -- Fix a bug when --fields contained start-time, end-time, and
     duration that caused the output to appear to contain two
     identically keyed bins.

  -- WARNING: These changes will affect the output of rwuniq.
* rwstats
  -- Remove limit on number of temporary files rwstats may open.

     mapping files for country code and address type.
* rwipaexport, rwipaimport
  -- Modified to require libipa-0.5.0.
* ipafilter.so
  -- New plug-in for rwfilter that supports partitioning flow records
     based on IPA data.
* PySiLK
  -- Minor bug fixes in site initialization.
  -- Other minor enhancements.
* rwpollexec
  -- New daemon that monitors a directory for files and invokes a
     user-supplied command on each file.
* rwflowpack
  -- Add new input mode, respool, that takes SiLK Flow files as input
     and puts the records into a data repository, maintaining the
     sensor and class/type values on the original records.
  -- Fix a bug when using multiple IPFIX directory-based probes.
* flowcap
  -- Add the --clock-time switch that allows flowcap to expire files
     at predictable wall-clock times.
* rwsender, rwreceiver
  -- Add a check to determine if the timestamps on the TLS
     certificates provided on the command line are valid.  Have the
     application write a log message and exit if the certificates are
     not valid.
  -- Explicitly check the timestamps of the TLS certificates received
     from the other side of the connection in order to provide a
     better log message when expired certificates are received.
  -- Fix issues in handling of simultaneous connections that could
     cause the process to hang.
  -- Fix issues during shutdown that could cause the process to hang.
* libsilk
  -- Fix an issue when reading compressed files that caused the
     uncompress function to be called more times than was necessary.
* Configuring/Building/C API
  -- Add an SK_ prefix to all CPP macros generated by autoconf to
     avoid conflicts with other packages that use autoconf.
  -- Change some features previously supported by plug-ins to be part
     of libsilk instead.  This affects country code (ccfilter),
     address type (addrtype), and prefix map (pmapfilter) support.


SiLK-2.3.1 Release, 2010-May-11

* rwflowpack
  -- Fix a bug in expiring flows from the stream cache that could
     cause rwflowpack to deadlock or to exit unexpectedly.
* rwscan
  -- Ignore additional flags when checking status of SYN flag.
* rwsort
  -- Fix a bug in the handling presorted input that would occur if
     rwsort ran out of file descriptors.
* rwstats
  -- Fix a bug in the handling presorted input that would occur if
     rwstats ran out of file descriptors.
  -- Fix a bug in merging temporary files when no distinct fields had
     been specified.
* rwuniq
  -- Fix a bug in the handling presorted input that would occur if
     rwuniq ran out of file descriptors.
  -- Fix a bug in merging temporary files when no distinct fields had
     been specified.


SiLK-2.3.0 Release, 2010-Apr-29

* rwfileinfo
  -- Determining the number of records in a file is much faster.
* silk.conf
  -- The sensor command now allows an optional textual description.
     To use this feature, the file's version must be set to 2.
* mapsid
  -- New --print-descriptions switch prints the description of the
     sensors (as set in the silk.conf file).
* rwflowpack
  -- Added a --flat-archive switch that prevents rwflowpack from
     creating subdirectories below the --archive-directory.
  -- The default size of the --file-cache, which determines the number
     of open files to use for writing, is now 128.  The file cache
     will now close files and remove them from the cache after a
     period of inactivity.  Improve performance of the file cache when
     attempting to write to more files than will fit into the cache.
  -- Improve performance when many poll-directory probes are defined,
     and fix an issue that could lead to too many open files.
  -- In the sensor.conf file, multiple probes may specified within a
     single sensor block.
  -- Modified NetFlow v9 support to require libfixbuf-1.0.0.
* rwflowappend
  -- Added a --flat-archive switch that prevents rwflowappend from
     creating subdirectories below the --archive-directory.
* rwreceiver
  -- Fix a bug in handling the --post-command.


SiLK-2.2.0 Release, 2010-Mar-17

* PySiLK
  -- Country code support is now available from PySiLK.  Use
     init_country_code() to initialize, and the IPAddr.country_code()
     method to return the country code.
  -- IPAddr() is replaced by IPv4Addr() and IPv6Addr() which both
     inherit from an IPAddr() object that will never be instantiated.
     IPAddr() is now a constructor for IPv4Addr() and IPv6Addr().
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The IPAddr() constructor no longer accepts an
     integer as an argument.  You must use IPv4Addr() or IPv6Addr().
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The IPAddr.to_ipv4() and IPAddr.to_ipv6()
     methods now return new IPv4Addr and IPv6Addr objects,
     respectively, and no longer modify the exiting IPAddr.
  -- New methods on IPAddr objects: mask(), mask_prefix(), octets().
  -- New method IPAddr.is_ipv6() should be used in place of
     IPAddr.isipv6() which is now deprecated.
  -- INCOMPATIBILITY: The deprecated IPAddr.ipv6() method has been
     removed.  Use IPAddr.is_ipv6() instead.
  -- Bug fixes in plug-in support.
* rwfilter
  -- New --scidr, --not-scidr, --dcidr, etc switches support
     partitioning by comma separated list of IPs and/or CIDR blocks.
* rwreceiver
  -- Add new --duplicate-destination switch that copies received files
     to an additional directory.  The switch may be repeated.
  -- Uses finer grained locking which should improve throughput when
     receiving from multiple rwsenders.
* rwsender
  -- Add new --local-directory switch that copies incoming files to a
     local directory (i.e., "send" to the local host).  The switch may
     be repeated.
* rwflowpack
  -- Add new --post-archive-command that specifies a command to run on
     an input file once rwflowpack has processed the file and moved
     the file to the archive directory.
* rwflowappend
  -- Add new --reject-hours-past and --reject-hours-future switches
     that allow rwflowappend to reject files whose records are outside
     a time window (based on the current time).
* flowcap
  -- Modify log message to report number of missing records when
     closing a file.
  -- Additional log messages added when using --log-level=debug.

     files that contained no records.
* rwresolve
  -- Fix a bug that would occur if the fields were not monotonically
     increasing.
* num2dot
  -- Fix a bug that resulted in a newline not being printed when
     converting the final column and there was no final delimiter.
* Prefix Maps
  -- Fix a bug on big-endian 64bit machines where a prefix map file
     would appear to have no entries.
* rwscanquery
  -- Fix a long-standing bug were rwscanquery used an old name for the
     rwsetcat command.
* Configuring/Building/C API
  -- Provide simplified APIs in C for creating new fields for rwcut,
     rwgroup, rwsort, rwstats, and rwuniq via plug-ins.  These APIs
     are similar to those available in PySiLK.
  -- New silk_config program can be used to determine the headers and
     libraries needed to link a program against the SiLK libraries.
  -- The hashlib_* functions are now part of libsilk and are no longer
     in a separate library (libhash).


SiLK-2.1.0 Release, 2009-Oct-28

* PySiLK
  -- New register_switch() function allows user to create a command
     line switch that can be used when PySiLK is running as a plug-in.
  -- Provide new functions to simplify the registering of fields when
     working with common data types.
* rwflowpack
  -- In the sensor.conf file, provide a way for the administrator to
     give a name to a list of IPs or interface values.
  -- When reading IPFIX, allow the VLAN identifiers to be stored in
     the SiLK Flow records in place of the SNMP interface numbers.
  -- Allow rwflowpack to discard records (as opposed to packing them)
     when the records have an IP address or an interface value that
     matches a list specified by the administrator.
* rwipfix2silk
  -- When reading IPFIX, allow the VLAN identifiers to be stored in
     the SiLK Flow records in place of the SNMP interface numbers.

  -- When reading IPFIX, allow the VLAN identifiers to be stored in
     the SiLK Flow records in place of the SNMP interface numbers.
* rwfilter
  -- Add --max-fail switch for consistency with --max-pass.
  -- New 'app-mismatch' plug-in will pass flows when the application
     determined by the flow generator does not match either the source
     or destination port.
  -- Fix a bug when running with multiple threads.
* rwcut
  -- Fix bug where --end-rec-num was being ignored when no other
     limiting switches were present.
* rwreceiver
  -- Fix a potential deadlock that could occur when an rwsender
     suddenly becomes unavailable.

  -- Fix an issue where we attempted to install rwp2yaf2silk twice.


SiLK-2.0.0 Release, 2009-Aug-20

* Prefix Maps
  -- Add a map-name keyword to rwpmapbuild which allows a MAPNAME to
     be specified in the prefix map file.
  -- Modify --pmap-file switch to allow an optional MAPNAME: to appear
     before the file name.
  -- Allow rwfilter to use multiple prefix maps in a single
     invocation: For each MAPNAME, switches --pmap-src-MAPNAME,
     --pmap-dst-MAPNAME, and --pmap-any-MAPNAME are generated to
     partition the SiLK Flow records.
  -- Allow rwcut, rwgroup, rwsort, rwstats, and rwuniq to use multiple
     prefix maps in a single invocation: For each MAPNAME, new
     src-MAPNAME and dst-MAPNAME fields are available.
  -- NOTE: The prefix map code is fully backward compatible with
     previous releases of SiLK.
* rwuniq
  -- Add --values switch that specifies the volumes (aggregate values)
     that rwuniq should compute.  Value columns will be printed in the
     order they appear in this list.

     written in PySiLK or C.
  -- Fix issue where IPv4 addresses were being printed as IPv6 by
     default.
  -- Fix a possible bug when sorted output is requested.
  -- WARNING: There is a slight difference in the names of the columns
     that contain the counts of distinct IPs.
* rwstats
  -- Add support for an arbitrary key.  The --fields switch specifies
     the fields that rwstats should as the key.  It supports the same
     fields as rwuniq.
  -- Add support for computing multiple volumes.  The --values switch
     specifies the volumes (aggregate values) that rwstats should
     compute.  Value columns will be printed in the order they appear
     in this list.  The first value column will be used as the basis
     for computing the top-N or bottom-N.
  -- Add support for country codes, for generating fields from prefix
     maps, and for defining fields by loading PySiLK or C plug-ins.
  -- Add support for defining new aggregate fields by loading plug-ins
     written in PySiLK or C.
  -- Add support for IPv6 (when enabled at compile time).
  -- Add numerous switches to specify the form of the output
     (--epoch-time, --integer-senors, etc).
  -- NOTE: rwstats continues to support the same switches, but many
     switches are now deprecated.
  -- WARNING: There are some differences in the headers and column
     titles that rwstats generates, and columns may have different
     widths.
* rwgroup
  -- Add support for the same fields as rwcut.
  -- Add support for country codes, for generating fields from prefix
     maps, and for defining fields by loading PySiLK or C plug-ins.
  -- Add support for IPv6 (when enabled at compile time).
  -- Allow the user to specify the initial ID to write into the next
     hop IP field via the --group-offset switch.
  -- Add support for the --output-path and --copy-input switches.
  -- WARNING: When the --delta-field refers to the source or
     destination IP address, the --delta-value switch is now taken to
     be the number of least significant bits to mask off prior to
     comparing the records.
* rwcompare
  -- New tool to determine whether two SiLK Flow files contain the
     same records in the same order (in the spirit of UNIX cmp).
* PySiLK
  -- Add Bag support (creating, reading, and writing).
  -- Add Prefix map support (read-only).
  -- Add operators to IPAddr objects for converting to IPv4 or IPv6.
  -- Add operator to IPAddr objects for returning a string that is
     fully expanded and padded with 0's.
  -- Modified the API for creating fields when PySiLK is used as a
     plug-in: register_field() replaces register_plugin_field().  The
     previous API is supported but deprecated.
  -- Provide new register_filter() function for rwfilter plug-ins.
  -- WARNING: The str() method on TCPFlags objects no longer pads the
     value with spaces.  Use the new padded() method on TCPFlags
     objects to get the old string presentation.
* General Changes
  -- Make the field names case insensitive in rwcut, rwdedupe,
     rwgroup, rwsort, rwstats, rwtuc, and rwuniq.
  -- Provide a new --plugin switch for loading C plug-ins.  The
     --dynamic-library switch on rwcut, rwfilter, rwflowpack, rwgroup,
     rwptoflow, rwsort, rwstats, and rwuniq is available but
     deprecated.
  -- Allow the SILK_COUNTRY_CODES environment variable to name the
     location of the country code (ccfilter.so) mapping file to use.
  -- Allow the SILK_ADDRESS_TYPES environment variable to name the
     location of the address types (addrtype.so) mapping file to use.
  -- Treat protocol 58 as ICMPv6 when SiLK is compiled with IPv6
     support.  The rwfilter --icmp-type and --icmp-code will match
     ICMPv6, and the icmpTypeCode field (rwcut, rwgroup, rwsort,
     rwstats, rwuniq) will decode the ICMPv6 type and code.
  -- Add annotation support (the --note-add family of switches) to
     rwgroup, rwipaexport, rwipfix2silk, rwnetmask, rwptoflow, rwsort,
     rwsplit, rwswapbytes, and rwtuc.
  -- Allow specification of the compression method to use for the
     output files created by rwgroup, rwipaexport, rwnetmask and
     rwsplit.
* rwnetmask

     --6dip-prefix-length, and --6nhip-prefix-length switches.
  -- Add new --4sip-prefix-length, --4dip-prefix-length, and
     --4nhip-prefix-length switches for consistency.  For backward
     compatibility, alias the existing --sip-prefix-length, etc,
     switches to these IPv4 names.
  -- Add support for the --ipv6-policy switch.
* rwbagcat
  -- Enhance the --network-structure switch to allow arbitrary CIDR
     blocks.  You can now print information about any CIDR block size.
  -- Add --mask-set switch to print the intersection of the Bag and
     the IPset.  With --zero-counts, prints a counter value for every
     IP in the IPset.
* rwbagtool
  -- Modify the --subtract operator to no longer treat negative
     counters as an error; instead the key is not included in the
     result.
  -- Modify the --divide operator to no longer treat values less than
     1 as an error; instead the key is not included in the result.
  -- Add the --scalar-multiply operator which takes a positive scalar
     argument and multiplies every counter in the Bag by that value.
  -- Add the --minimize operator which creates a Bag that contains,
     for each key in the input Bags, the smallest counter.  A missing
     key is treated as if its counter is 0.
  -- Add the --maximize operator which creates a Bag that contains,
     for each key in the input Bags, the largest counter.
  -- Add the --compare operator to compares the contents of two Bags.
  -- WARNING: Remove the deprecated --output-file switch.  Use
     --output-path instead.
* rwpmapcat
  -- Add --left-justify-labels switch that causes the labels to be
     left justified instead of right justified.
  -- Allow the map to read to simply be specified on the command line;
     that is, no longer require the use of the --map-file switch.
* rwsetbuild
  -- No longer require the file name arguments.  rwsetbuild writes to
     the standard output when only one file is specified;
     additionally, it reads from the standard input when no files are
     specified.
* rwsetcat
  -- Enhance the --network-structure switch to allow arbitrary CIDR
     blocks.  You can now print information about any CIDR block size.
* rwsplit
  -- Allow the user to specify value used to initialize the
     pseudo-random number generator via the new --seed switch.
* rwcat
  -- Add --byte-order switch to allows the user to set the byte order
     of the output file.
  -- Add --ipv4-output switch to allows the user to force the output
     to be SiLK's default IPv4 format.
* rwfilter
  -- Modify the --flags-all, --flags-initial, and --flags-session
     switches to allow a comma separated list of HIGH/MASK flag pairs.
  -- Modify the --attributes switch to allow a comma separated list of
     HIGH/MASK attribute pairs.
* rwscan
  -- Fix a bug in the Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) method that
     may have caused it to miss some scans.
* rwflowpack
  -- The "flowcap" input mode (which allowed rwflowpack to connect to
     a flowcap running in server-mode) has been removed.  Use
     rwsender/rwreceiver to transfer files instead.
  -- Add support for processing files created by yaf.
  -- Add support for processing SiLK flow files.
  -- Add the --verify-sensor-config switch which causes rwflowpack to
     exit after checking the syntax of the sensor.conf file.
* flowcap
  -- The "server-mode" (which allowed rwflowpack to contact flowcap)
     has been removed.  Use rwsender/rwreceiver to transfer files.
  -- Add the --verify-sensor-config switch which causes flowcap to
     exit after checking the syntax of the sensor.conf file.
* rwsender, receiver
  -- Fix bugs related to using TLS.
  -- Make daemons more robust with respect to sudden loss of
     connectivity to their peer(s).
  -- Better handle duplicate files and partially transferred files.
  -- Fix a race condition in rwsender when attempting to transfer a
     file to multiple rwreceivers.
  -- Add --error-directory switch to rwsender.  rwsender will move to
     this directory any files that failed to transfer.  The
     --error-directory switch is required.
* C-Code changes
  -- Header files have been moved from src/include to src/include/silk
     and files should use '#include <silk/foo.h>' for file foo.h.
  -- Rewrite the API to plug-ins.  The old API is still supported, but
     it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  -- Provide a new API to IPsets.
  -- Many additional changes.

     variable.  When set, errors in the Python code will be reported
     to the user.
  -- FUNCTIONAL CHANGE: IPSet.add(), IPSet.discard(), and
     IPSet.remove() now accept only a single IPAddr or a single IP

SiLK-1.1.3 Release, 2008-Nov-21

* rwsender
  -- Greatly reduce the memory requirement of rwsender by
     memory-mapping the files as they are sent.  Previously, the files
     were read into RAM, causing the rwsender process to have a large
     memory footprint.

  -- Writing of records by rwflowpack has been greatly enhanced by
     using finer-grained locking and using pthread read/write locks on
     systems that support them.
  -- New --error-directory switch allows rwflowpack to continue
     processing files in spite of an invalid input flow file.
     Previously, an invalid input file would cause rwflowpack to exit.
     rwflowpack will still exit unless the --error-directory is set.
  -- New --file-cache-size switch allows the user to control the
     number of output files that rwflowpack has open simultaneously.

     allocate enough memory for the Prefix Map.


SiLK-1.1.1 Release, 2008-Aug-08

* rwip2cc
  -- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY. When reading the IP input from a file,
     the default output is now two columns: the IP and the country
     code.  The output for a single IP is unchanged.
  -- Use the new --print-ips switch to force whether IPs should be
     printed.
  -- Additional switches have been added to control the format of the
     columns.
* rwfilter
  -- New --flowtype switch allows selection of data from multiple
     class/type pair, including data from different classes.
  -- Support for the --tuple-* switch is now compiled into rwfilter
     instead of being supported by a plug-in.
  -- Fix a crash that would occur when a class in silk.conf listed no
     default types.
* flowrate.so
  -- A new plugin exists to filter, display, sort, and bin by
     packets-per-second, bytes-per-second, and bytes-per-packet.  The

  -- Fix a crash that would occur when attempting to read SiLK flows
     from a non-flow file.


SiLK-1.1.0 Release, 2008-Jul-09

* PySiLK
  -- Change the default install location for PySiLK so it is now
     installed with other Python modules.  Use the configure script's
     --with-python-prefix switch to change the install location.
  -- Extend the PySiLK capability to support user-defined fields in
     rwsort and rwuniq.
  -- Change the way the user defines PySiLK fields for rwcut.
     POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY.
  -- Fix a reference counting bug that led to a memory leak.

     rwuniq will use temporary files to allow it to process more bins
     than will fit in memory.
  -- Fix an issue where rwuniq would not correctly process multiple
     input files when the --presorted-input switch was given.
* rwtotal
  -- Add the ability to print only bins that meet minimum and/or
     maximum thresholds for bytes, packets, and/or record counts.
* rwaddrcount
  -- Provide new --min-* and --max-* switches as aliases to the
     existing --rec-min, --rec-max, etc switches.

  -- Improve the logging.
* rwflowappend
  -- Fix issue where rwflowappend would exit if the final record in an
     incremental file was invalid.
* rwflowpack
  -- Enhance the sensor.conf syntax and packing logic so that all
     flow records collected from a particular probe can be labeled as
     traveling between two networks.  This allows all flows seen by
     that probe to be labeled as incoming, for example.
  -- In sensor.conf, rename the netflow probe to netflow-v5, but allow
     netflow as an alias for netflow-v5 for compatibility.
* flowcap
  -- In sensor.conf, rename the netflow probe to netflow-v5, but allow
     netflow as an alias for netflow-v5 for compatibility.


SiLK-1.0.1 Release, 2008-May-01

* rwcut
  -- Extended the PySiLK capability to support user-defined columns in
     rwcut.
* rwmatch
  -- Enhancements to allow both sides of the conversation to be
     included in the output.
* cutmatch.so
  -- A new plug-in to print the values that rwmatch writes into the
     next-hop IP field.

     value was not being byte-swapped).
* flowcap, rwflowpack, rwflowappend, rwreceiver, rwsender
  -- Fix a fatal bug in the start-up of daemons that occurred when
     logging was set to "syslog" or "none".
* Additional minor bug fixes


SiLK-1.0.0 Release, 2008-Mar-31

* rwfilter can support filtering using expressions written in Python,
  and it is possible to manipulate SiLK Flow records from within
  Python.  This feature requires Python 2.4 or later, and you must
  specify --with-python when you run configure.  See the "PySiLK: SiLK
  in Python" language reference documentation, and the --python-expr
  and --python-file switches on rwfilter.
* Preliminary support for IPv6 addresses can be included.  Use the
  --enable-ipv6 switch on the configure script to include IPv6 support
  in SiLK.  When IPv6 is present, rwfilter provides a --ip-version
  switch to filter on IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses, and the tools rwuniq
  and rwcut provide a --ipv6-policy switch (and SILK_IPV6_POLICY
  environment variable) that controls the display of IPv6 addresses.
* rwfilter now supports threads.  Performance is greatly improved for
  queries that look at many files but return few records.  Use the
  --threads switch on rwfilter or the SILK_RWFILTER_THREADS
  environment variable to control the number of threads.  By default,
  rwfilter will use a single thread.  Our testing has found that
  performance peaks around four threads per CPU, but performance will
  vary depending on the type of query and the number of records
  returned.
* There are new binary SiLK file formats, and the format of every SiLK
  file has changed.  SiLK-1.0.0 can read files created by earlier
  versions of SiLK; however, releases prior to SiLK-1.0.0 will not be
  able to read SiLK-1.0.0 files.  Binary SiLK files now contain
  additional information in their headers, including the version of
  SiLK that produced the file.
* Delimited textual output has changed in almost all tools.  Note this
  is a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY and may break scripts.  A new
  --no-final-delimiter switch prevents printing of the final delimiter
  in the textual output of rwaddrcount, rwbagcat, rwcount, rwcut,
  rwpmapcat, rwsetcat, rwstats, rwtotal, rwuniq.  In addition, the
  --delimited switch now enables --no-final-delimiter, making it
  easier for the output to be parsed by other tools.  If you need to
  maintain compatibility with earlier versions of SiLK, replace
  --delimited=X with --no-columns --column-sep=X.
* Arbitrary notes (annotations) can be added to the headers of some
  SiLK files.  Use the --note-add=TEXT to add a note, or
  --note-file-add=FILE to add text from a file.  The rwfileinfo tool
  will view the notes.  Notes are supported by rwbag, rwbagbuild,
  rwbagtool, rwcat, rwfilter, rwset, rwsetbuild, rwsettool.
* Site information is completely determined at run-time.  The
  rules that rwflowpack uses to categorize flows are now controlled by
  a run-time plug-in that rwflowpack loads.  The name of the plug-in
  must be passed to rwflowpack via the --packing-logic switch, or set
  in the silk.conf file.
* The sensor.conf file used by rwflowpack and flowcap has a completely
  different syntax.  See the Installation Handbook and the
  rwflowpack(8) and sensor.conf(5) manual pages.  The
  update-sensor-conf script converts the old syntax to the new.
* A new rwidsquery tool is provided.  rwidsquery takes a Snort alert
  log or rule file and invokes rwfilter with the appropriate arguments
  to find the SiLK flow records that match the input file.
* Bugs have been fixed in processing times on Solaris when the
  machine's timezone was not UTC.
* Configuring SiLK to use legacy timestamps by default is no longer
  supported.  The --legacy-timestamps switch is still supported on the
  applications.
* When looking for support files (such as country_codes.pmap), tools
  will look in $SILK_PATH/share/silk/ and $SILK_PATH/share/, but they
  no longer look in $SILK_PATH/.
* buildset, readset, setintersect, rwset-union
  -- These symbolic links to rwsetbuild, rwsetcat, rwsetintersect, and
     rwsetunion are no longer created.
* rwaddrcount
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwbag
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
* rwbagbuild
  -- The --output switch has been renamed to --output-path.
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
* rwbagcat
  -- The --output switch has been renamed to --output-path.
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwbagtool
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
  -- The --output-file switch is deprecated.  Use --output-path
     instead.
* rwcat
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
* rwcount
  -- Enhancement to support millisecond-sized bins.  Specify a
     fractional value to the --bin-size switch: --bin-size=0.500.
  -- As a side effect of this millisecond capability, the output from
     the default load scheme (--load-scheme=4, splitting a flow by its
     active time) will now divide flows across each millisecond that
     the flow is active.  This results in slightly different output.
  -- New --end-epoch switch allows user to control the final bin to
     print.
  -- The --delimiter switch has been removed.  Use the
     --column-separator switch instead.  (Note that the --delimited
     switch still exists).
  -- See also discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwcut
  -- A new --all-fields switch causes all possible fields to be
     printed.
  -- New --ipv6-policy switch controls how IPv6 flows are handled.
  -- See also discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwdedupe
  -- The --identical-fields switch has been renamed to
     --ignore-fields, and --sort-buffer-size has been renamed to
     --buffer-size.
* rwfileinfo
  -- Output has changed to reflect new SiLK binary file headers.
* rwfilter
  -- New --python-expr and --python-file switches.
  -- New --threads switch.
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
  -- New tuple.so plug-in filters flow records based on any subset of
     the five-tuple {source-ip, destination-ip, source-port,
     destination-port, protocol}.  The --ippair-any and --ipport-any
     switches are deprecated.
  -- The --ippair-any and --ipport-any switches no longer work for
     files that use only TAB characters between the two columns of
     input.  Change the TAB characters to spaces.
  -- New --ip-version switch when IPv6 support is enabled.
  -- Fix an issue where an error writing to the file system was not
     being correctly reported.
  -- Fix a bug that caused the --site-config-file switch to be
     ignored.
* rwmatch
  -- New --unmatched switch allows unmatched records to be written to
     the output.
  -- New --symmetric-delta switch allows either input file to contain
     the initiating flow.
* rwpmapbuild
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
  -- rwpmapbuild has been rewritten as a C application.
* rwpmapcat
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwnetmask
  -- Enhancement so that it takes file names from the command line and
     produces a file as output.
  -- Renamed switches to be more consistent with other tools but leave
     the old names for compatibility.
* rwscan
  -- Existing output files are no longer overwritten.
  -- Printing of each file name processed, thread creation, etc. is
     now only done when the user specifies --verbose-progress on the
     command line.
  -- New --verbose-results prints information about each IP.
  -- New switches allow setting the parameters used by the TWR
     algorithm.
  -- New --integer-ips switch to print IPs as integers.
  -- In the printed output, headers and output records now end with a
     delimiter by default.  This can be turned off with
     --no-final-delimiter.
  -- The --scandb switch enables --no-final-delimiter.
  -- The --output-file switch has been renamed to --output-path.
  -- Improved manual page.
* rwset: POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY.
  -- Running rwset with no arguments will no longer produce an IPset.
     The IPset(s) to create MUST now be specified with the --sip,
     --dip, and/or --nhip switches.
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
* rwsetbuild
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
* rwsetcat
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwsettool
  -- See discussion of --note-add above.
* rwstats
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwtotal
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* rwuniq: POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY.
  -- The --threshold switch is no longer supported.  Use the --flows
     switch instead.
  -- The output from rwuniq may appear in a different order due from
     previous releases due to changes in the internal hash table.
  -- The --sip-distinct and --dip-distinct switches are handled more
     efficiently for sparse IPs.
  -- New --ipv6-policy switch controls how IPv6 flows are handled.
  -- See discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
* Summary of changes that may break old scripts or usage patterns
  -- See the discussion of --no-final-delimiter above.
  -- rwbagbuild: The --output switch has been renamed to
     --output-path.  Since --output is a legal abbreviation of
     --output-path, no end-user effects should be seen.
  -- rwbagtool: The --output switch has been renamed to --output-path.
     Since --output is a legal abbreviation of --output-path, no
     end-user effects should be seen.
  -- rwcount: The --delimiter switch has been removed.  Use the
     --column-separator switch instead.  (Note that the --delimited
     switch still exists).
  -- rwdedupe: The --identical-fields switch has been renamed to
     --ignore-fields, and --sort-buffer-size has been renamed to
     --buffer-size.
  -- rwtotal: The --delimiter switch has been removed.  Use the
     --column-separator switch instead.  (Note that the --delimited
     switch still exists).
  -- rwuniq: The --threshold switch is no longer supported.  Use the
     --flows switch instead.
* For programmers
  -- The IP address is now an abstract object.
  -- All access to the fields of an rwRec should occur through the
     rwRec* wrappers.
  -- Time is now represented as an sktime_t (a signed 64bit integer),
     representing milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
  -- There have been many changes to the library functions.
* The following incompatible changes exist in the packing tools
  -- The sensor.conf syntax is completely different.
  -- rwflowpack: When processing PDU-files as input, you need to use
     --input-mode=pdufile instead of --input-mode=file.
  -- rwflowpack: The --fc-address and --fc-port switches have been
     removed; use --flowcap-address and --flowcap-port instead.
  -- flowcap: The --sensors switch has been removed.  The --probes
     switch offers similar functionality, but takes the names of
     probes, not sensors.


SiLK-0.11.9 Release, 2008-Jan-17

* rwfilter
  -- Provide a mechanism to log statistics about the commands that
     were run and the number of files and records involved.

  -- Fix occasional crashes when collecting flows from IPFIX sensors.
     To collect flows from an IPFIX sensor, libfixbuf-0.7.2 or
     greater is now required.
* rwstats
  -- Fix a bug in the output generated by the --overall-stats switch
     where the maximum would not be displayed correctly when the input
     consisted of a single flow.
* rwsender, rwreceiver
  -- Fix a bug that was causing frequent retries and disconnects
     between rwsender and rwreceiver.
* rwaddrcount, rwcount, rwcut, rwtotal
  -- Fix a bug where --output-path=/dev/null would send the textual
     output to stdout.
* rwtuc
  -- Do not create the "bad-input-lines" file when all of the input is
     successfully processed.
* rwdedupe
  -- New tool to remove duplicate SiLK Flow records from a file.
* libippair.so
  -- New plug-in for rwfilter to partition flow records based on the
     source and destination IPs as a pair.
* rwsort
  -- New --presorted-input switch allows rwsort to process previously
     sorted files (rwsort will merge-sort the files).
* rwsetbuild
  -- Now supports input having an IP range on each line when the
     --ip-ranges switch is specified.
* rwsettool
  -- Added a new --mask operation so a user can see which IP blocks
     contain an IP address.


SiLK-0.11.7 Release, 2007-Sep-06

* rwsender, rwreceiver
  -- rwsender and rwreceiver can encrypt their communication if the
     GnuTLS library is found when SiLK is configured.
* rwnetmask
  -- Always write the SiLK headers to the output file so that files
     with no data are still valid SiLK files.
* rwrandomizeip
  -- Always write the SiLK headers to the output file so that files
     with no data are still valid SiLK files.
* rwswapbytes
  -- Always write the SiLK headers to the output file so that files
     with no data are still valid SiLK files.
* rwsender
  -- Fix a bug where rwsender was not properly closing files, leading
     rwsender to eventually run out of file descriptors.
  -- Fix a bug that causes rwsender to crash when it loses the
     connection to an rwreceiver during the transfer of a file.
* rwflowpack
  -- Fix a bug in reading flowcap files on 64bit platforms that caused
     the records in the file to be ignored.
* rwscanquery

     the --output-path switch.
* rwcut, rwuniq
  -- Fix several issues in rwcut and rwuniq when dealing with prefix

     characters.  A new --pmap-column-width switch is available to
     limit the number of characters that are printed.
* rwfilter
  -- Fix a bug where the --icmp-type and --icmp-code were not
     filtering out non-ICMP traffic.
* rwscan
  -- Fix a bug by closing the output after all worker threads have
     joined.  This fixes the problem of missing output and double
     free() errors.
* rwcut
  -- Fix a bug where the --copy-input switch was not copying its
     input.
  -- Fix a bug where, when displaying the end-time and the
     milliseconds value was larger than 1000, rwcut was not properly
     incrementing the seconds value.
* rwset
  -- Fix misplaced text in the rwset man page.

     SiLK-0.11.1 release.
  -- In the src/libskipfix and src/rwipa directories, make certain the
     CFLAGS found during configuration are passed to CC when building.


SiLK-0.11.1 Release, 2007-May-17

This release has many changes from the previous SiLK-0.10.5 Release.

End user features, enhancements, and bug fixes
* New scan detection system: rwscan and rwscanquery
  -- rwscan reads SiLK Flow data and uses a hybrid of Threshold Random
     Walk and Bayesian Logistic Regression to detect scanning
     activity.  rwscan output textual records describing the scan.  If
     these are inserted into a relational database, rwscanquery can be
     used to query for the scanning activity.  rwscanquery can query
     Oracle, Postgres, or MySQL databases.
* New tools for IPFIX support
  -- rwsilk2ipfix converts SiLK Flow records to an IPFIX format.
  -- rwipfix2silk converts IPFIX flow records to the SiLK format.
  -- These tools can be used in place of the rwp2yaf2silk script.
  -- Support for these tools requires that libfixbuf-0.6.0
     (http://tools.netsa.cert.org/fixbuf/) be installed prior to
     building SiLK.
* New tools for IP storage
  -- rwipaexport takes IP addresses from an IP Address Association
     (IPA) catalog and creates a SiLK IPset, Bag, or Prefix Map
     (pmap).
  -- rwipaimport enters the IP addresses from a SiLK IPset, Bag, or
     Prefix Map into an IPA catalog.
  -- Support for these tools requires that libipa-0.2.0
     (http://tools.netsa.cert.org/ipa/) be installed prior to building
     SiLK.
* Additional new tools
  -- rwsplit divides a SiLK Flow file into smaller files based on the
     number of flows, bytes, packets, or unique IPs.  It also provides
     the ability to sample the input.
  -- rwsettool provides the functionality of rwsetintersect and
     rwsetunion and additional functions such as set difference and
     sampling of an IPset.  The rwsetintersect and rwsetunion tools
     are deprecated.
  -- rwsetmember determines if a (textual) IP is a member of an IPset.
     Determining this in previous releases of SiLK required filtering
     the output of rwsetcat or creating an IPset containing a single
     IP.
  -- rwpmapcat prints the contents of a Prefix Map (pmap) file.
* rwfilter enhancements and bug fixes
  -- Allow the parameter to the --flags-all, --flags-init, and
     --flags-session switches to be a list of HIGH/MASK pairs
     separated by commas, e.g., --flags-all=S/S,A/A.
  -- Do not print statistics or create output files when the --dry-run
     switch is specified.
  -- Fix a file corruption issue that would occur when processing
     multiple files if the first input file was not successfully
     opened: the output file would be generated without a SiLK header.
  -- Exit with a non-zero exit status if the class, type, or sensor
     values are invalid.
  -- Fix a bug in processing the --start-date and --end-date switches
     when local timezone support was enabled and the local timezone
     was east of UTC.
* rwbag enhancements and bug fixes
  -- rwbag now supports creating Bags whose key is the sensor ID, next
     hop IP, input interface or output interface.
  -- Allow rwbag to act like UNIX tee(1) by adding the --copy-input
     switch.  This switch sends all SiLK Flow input to the specified
     file, stream, or named pipe.
  -- Print errors as human readable text, not error codes
  -- Fix a bug with releasing memory multiple times when rwbag ran out
     of memory.
* rwrandomizeip enhancement
  -- Allow the user to restrict the set of IPs that are modified via
     two command line arguments: --dont-change-set and
     --only-change-set.  Both switches take an IPset; the first switch
     prevents the IP from being changed; the second causes only the
     listed IPs to be changed.
* mapsid enhancement
  -- The --print-classes switch will print the class(es) to which each
     sensor belongs.
* rwcount enhancement and changes
  -- Implement the --output-path switch which directs rwcount to
     write its output to the specified location.
  -- Allow rwcount to act like UNIX tee(1) by adding the --copy-input
     switch.  This switch sends all SiLK Flow input to the specified
     file, stream, or named pipe.
  -- The column widths have changed slightly
* rwaddrcount enhancement
  -- Implement the --output-path and --copy-input switches as
     described for rwcount.
* rwcut enhancement
  -- Implement the --output-path and --copy-input switches as
     described for rwcount.
* rwstats enhancement
  -- Implement the --output-path and --copy-input switches as
     described for rwcount.
* rwset enhancement
  -- Implement the --copy-input switch as described for rwcount.
* rwtotal enhancement
  -- Implement the --output-path switch as described for rwcount.
* rwuniq enhancement
  -- Implement the --output-path switch as described for rwcount.
* rwsetcat bug fix
  -- Fix bug where the $PAGER was not being used.
* rwbagcat bug fixes
  -- Do not print a warning message when attempting to print an empty
     Bag or when the min/max limits caused no entries to be printed.
  -- Fix bug where the $PAGER was not being used.
  -- Print errors as human readable text, not error codes
* rwbagtool bug fix
  -- Print errors as human readable text, not error codes
* rwcat bug fix
  -- Modify rwcat so it will always print the SiLK header to a file,
     even when no records are present
* rwappend enhancement and bug fix
  -- New --print-statistics switch causes the number of records
     processed to be printed to the standard error.
  -- Output change: Modified rwappend so it only prints the number of
     records processed when --print-statistics is given.
  -- Fix a problem that occurred when SiLK was compiled with
     compression enabled by default and the applications were
     processing SiLK files produced by releases of SiLK prior to
     0.10.5: the application would exit with the error message
     "Operation not permitted on compressed file" and no output would
     be generated.
* rwswapbytes bug fix
  -- See compression-related bug fix for rwappend
* rwnetmask bug fix
  -- See compression-related bug fix for rwappend

Administration and configuration changes
* New "silk.conf" file removes the requirement that sensors be defined
  at compile-time.
  -- The sensors, classes, and types are now defined at run-time
     through the use of a "silk.conf" text file.  This file should be
     installed in the SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR directory.
  -- The run-time configuration allows a single installation of the
     analysis tools to query multiple data sets; simply set the
     SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR environment variable to the location of the
     data.
  -- The location of this file can also be specified by setting the
     SILK_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to its location, or by
     using the --site-config-file switch on most SiLK applications.
  -- The packer (rwflowpack) still requires certain classes and types
     to be defined, and it cannot use new classes and types without
     modifying C code.  This restriction will go away in a future
     release.
* Major changes to the build system
  -- The build system now uses all aspects of the GNU Autotools chain
     including 'automake' and 'libtool'.
  -- The tools can now be built with shared library support, reducing
     the size of the binaries and allowing the kernel to use a single
     copy of libsilk when multiple SiLK tools are running.
  -- Note that the use of shared libraries means the binaries can no
     longer easily be relocated; instead you should run "make install"
     again with the new location.
  -- The SiLK headers are now copied to the install target directory
  -- GNU make is no longer required to build the tools.
* New packing rules are used by default.
  -- The default site has changed from "generic" to "twoway".  The
     twoway site allows flow records to be categorized and stored as
     internal-to-internal (int2int) and external-to-external
     (ext2ext).  In addition, the "out" type is no longer everything
     that is not "in".  The files created by the generic site are
     forward compatible with the twoway site; however, if you wish to
     continue using your current packing rules, run configure with
     the --enable-silk-site=generic switch.  See the Installation
     Handbook for details.
* New transfer daemons: rwsender and rwreceiver.
  -- These are meant to replace the direct connectivity between
     flowcap and rwflowpack.  These daemons allow the flowcap files to
     be sent to multiple rwflowpack processes.
  -- In addition, they allow rwflowpack to process data on one system
     and send small files containing SiLK Flow records (called
     "incremental files") to another system (where the rwflowappend
     daemon is running) for analysis.
* New packing tool: rwflowappend
  -- rwflowappend appends SiLK Flow records contained in "incremental
     files" to hourly files.
* Changes to flowcap and rwflowpack
  -- The flowcap and rwflowpack tools have been modified to work with
     the new rwsender and rwreceiver, though they can also be used in
     legacy mode.  With the transport removed from flowcap, flowcap
     files can now be sent to multiple locations.
* IPFIX flow collection enhancement
  -- Previous releases of SiLK (rwflowpack and flowcap) could only
     read IPFIX streams generated by YAF.  With this release, SiLK can
     read flows from any IPFIX-compliant generator.
* Remove zlib requirement in rwflowpack
  -- Allow rwflowpack to be built even if zlib is not available.
     However, rwflowpack will not be able to read files of NetFlow
     PDUs when zlib is not present.
* New packing tool: rwpackchecker
  -- rwpackchecker performs a basic integrity check of a packed SiLK
     file.



SiLK-0.10.5 Release, 2006-Dec-12

* Data file version number bump
  -- Fix a forward compatibility issue in SiLK between releases prior
     to 0.10.0 and releases 0.10.0 through 0.10.4 when data
     compression is enabled (either via the
     --enable-output-compression switch to 'configure' or the
     --compression-method switch to various applications).  Versions
     of SiLK prior to 0.10.0 did not check the value of the
     'compression' byte in the header; when reading a SiLK file from
     0.10.0 with compression enabled, these versions will silently
     attempt to read the data section without uncompressing it,
     leading to incorrect output.

     The issue is resolved in SiLK 0.10.5 by incrementing the version
     number of every SiLK file format that supports compression of the
     data section of the file (IPsets, Bags, and the output from
     rwfilter, rwcat, rwsort, rwflowpack, and rwptoflow).

     We recommend using the "silk-version-bump-0-10-5" script included
     with the distribution to increment the version number of files
     created with releases of SiLK prior to 0.10.5 that have
     compression enabled.  The script will only modify SiLK files that
     have compression enabled; it will not modify non-SiLK files nor
     SiLK files that do no have compression enabled.
* rwcount change
  -- IMPORTANT.  The default binning mode (load-scheme) has changed.
     The former scheme put each flow's entire volume into the first
     second of the flow.  The new scheme evenly divides the volume
     across each second of the flow's duration, which should help
     reduce "spikiness" in the data.  Any scripts that rely on the
     former method should have "--load-scheme=1" added explicitly to
     rwcount's invocation.
* rwuniq enhancement and bug fix
  -- New flag "--presorted-input" makes rwuniq assume that the data
     has been sorted with rwsort using the same set of "--fields".
     This reduces rwuniq's memory requirement and allows it to work
     like it's UNIX counterpart 'uniq'.
  -- Fix a memory fault that could occur when using the --sip-distinct
     and/or --dip-distinct switches on large data sets.
* rwfilter changes
  -- rwfilter will continue to process even if there is a problem with
     an input file.
  -- rwfilter will now process multiple RWFILTER input files, though
     it prints a warning that file history is being lost.
  -- rwfilter supports time filtering (via the --stime and --etime
     switches) to the millisecond.
* New script 'rwp2yaf2silk'
  -- rwp2yaf2silk converts a file of pcap data to SiLK Flow data; the
     script requires that the SiLK tool 'rwtuc' is installed and that
     the tools 'yaf' and 'yafscii' (http://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/)
     are installed.
* rwbagcat bug fix
  -- Make certain the --bin-ips=linear switch properly handles Bag
     entries where the count is greater than 4294967295.  These
     entries are now attributed to the maximum key unless the
     --maxcount value is used to filter out those entries.
  -- When printing the output from --bin-ips=decimal, properly print
     the key when its value is greater than 4294967295.
  -- Set the output column width to 20 to maintain the columnar output
     when the value is very large.
  -- Support values larger than 4294967295 in the --mincount and
     --maxcount switches.
* rwbagtool bug fix
  -- Fix a bug in the --invert switch which resulted in incorrect
     results in the output.  This would occur when the value was
     larger than the current key.
  -- Make certain the --invert switch properly handles Bag entries
     where the count is greater than 4294967295.  These entries are
     now attributed to the maximum key unless the --maxcount value is
     used to filter out those entries.
  -- Allow the --invert switch to support multiple Bag files by adding
     the Bags (making the switch consistent with the --coverset,
     --intersect, and --complement-intersect switches).  This fixes an
     assertion that would cause the program to abort.
  -- Support values larger than 4294967295 in the --mincount and
     --maxcount switches.
* rwflowpack input check
  -- When processing NetFlow data from a file, rwflowpack now checks
     that the input data is in NetFlow v5 format.  Previously, the
     version check was not made and the file would be processed as if
     it contained NetFlow v5 data.
* rwpmatch enhancement and bug fix
  -- Provide --ports-compare and --msec-compare switches to have
     rwpmatch compare port data and compare times down to the
     millisecond.
  -- Fix a bug that caused rwpmatch to assume every packet would have
     a corresponding flow.
  -- Be more diligent about testing the length and type of packets we
     read.
* rwtuc change
  -- Always print the SiLK header to the output, even when records
     were read from the input.
* flowcap fixes
  -- Fix a bug in flowcap that caused it to process data from only the
     final sensor listed in the sensor-configuration file.
  -- Fix bugs in the flowcap control script.
* File relocation
  -- The man page "sensorconf.5" has been renamed "sensor.conf.5".
  -- The source POD for man pages has moved from src/APP/doc/APP.pod
     to src/APP/APP.pod.


SiLK-0.10.3 Release, 2006-Nov-15

* Fix a major bug in rwbagbuild that caused rwbagbuild to ignore every
  other line of its input.
* Fix a bug in the prefix map (pmap) support that caused rwsort to
  crash when attempting to sort using fields defined in a pmap.
* Fix syntax errors in the rwfpd script that runs rwflowpack.  These
  errors were invoked when the compression was not set or when the
  name of the script included a sensor-name suffix.
* Add a --no-file-locking switch to rwflowpack.  With this switch,
  rwflowpack will not attempt to get a write lock when writing flows
  to data files.  This switch is required for rwflowpack use
  file systems that do not support file locking.  During normal
  operation multiple rwflowpacks should never attempt to write to the
  same file; the use of advisory locks is not strictly necessary, but
  it provides protection during unusual circumstances.
* Modify rwflowpack so that when it encounters a disk error (unable to
  open file, obtain a lock, write the flow, etc) when trying to write
  a flow, it stops processing flows for that probe.  If all probes
  encounter disk errors, rwflowpack will exit.
* Fix a bug related to the sensor.conf file; the growth factor for an
  array was too small which caused rwflowpack to abort.
* Fix a bug in parsing time ranges when fractional seconds were
  present.
* Ensure that compressing flows with the LZO compressor always
  produces the same binary output by clearing the temporary buffer
  that is passed into LZO.
* Fix a communication issue between flowcap and rwflowpack: on slow
  and noisy networks, the ACK which rwflowpack sends to flowcap
  indicating that it has received a file could be lost.  Since flowcap
  never received the ACK, it would resend the same file to rwflowpack
  thinking the first attempt had failed.  rwflowpack would store both
  files, resulting in duplicate flows in the packed data.  rwflowpack
  now stores the name of the most recent file it received.  If it
  receives a file with the same name, the second file is ignored.


SiLK-0.10.0 Release, 2006-Oct-06

* There is a new Analysts' Handbook: Using SiLK for Network Traffic
  Analysis.  This document provides a tutorial on learning the SiLK
  tools and describes doing analysis with the tools.  The manual pages
  that used to be in that document have been moved into a separate
  document: The SiLK Reference Guide.
* The SiLK packing tools now support reading IPFIX records generated
  by the YAF Flow Sensor (http://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/).  YAF must
  be installed prior to configuring SiLK.
* When used with YAF, SiLK supports additional fields for dealing with
  TCP data: The flags on the first packet on the flow are stored
  separately from the flags on the other packets in the flow.  In
  addition, when a TCP session is broken into multiple flows, the
  flows are specially marked.
* SiLK now supports using an external compression library to further
  compress the "data" section of files, while leaving the "header" of
  the file uncompressed.  This compression is available on SiLK Flow
  files, as well as IPsets and Bags.  The supported compression
  methods are "none", "zlib", and "lzo1x", subject to library
  availability.  Most tools allow one to specify the compression.  The
  default compression is set when the 'configure' script is run
  (--enable-output-compression).
* The logging library has been rewritten, and now supports syslog(3).
  Logging messages can also be written to the standard error.
  "Legacy" logging is still supported (SiLK can still write its log
  files in a directory and rotate the files), but note that the FORMAT
  OF LOG MESSAGES HAS CHANGED.  Also, rwflowpack will no longer
  automatically include the value passed to --sensor-name switch as
  part of the log file name and PID file name.  (The rwfpd init script
  works around this; see the SiLK Installation Handbook.)
* For people upgrading from previous releases, note that the list of
  sensors has been moved from silk_site_generic.h to
  generic_sensors.h.  Also note that the macros around the sensor list
  have changed; please edit carefully.  See the SiLK Installation
  Handbook.
* A new library, libsksetbag, contains the functions to manipulate
  IPsets and Bags.  libiptree has been removed; use libsksetbag
  instead.
* Additional manual pages have been added.
* Additional changes
  -- rwptoflow: does a better job of checking the validity of its
     input; has plug-in support; new switches allow it to produce
     "pass" and "fail" streams of pcap data and/or print statistics.
  -- rwsort: when it receives no input, it now produces a SiLK Flow
     file with no readers (only a header).  Previously it would
     produce a completely empty file.
  -- rwfileinfo: output changed to include new compression method.
  -- flowcap: add a switch to manually set the ack timeout, which is
     useful on slow networks.


SiLK-0.9.10 Release, 2006-Aug-23

* Critical bug fix
  -- Fix a byte-swapping bug in FT_RWWWW V3 records.  When converting
     an rwRec from or to this format and where the conversion included
     a byte-swap, the record would be corrupted.  As long as all SiLK
     data was handled in the machine's native byte order, the bug
     would not manifest itself (the initial read of the NetFlow data
     was/is handled correctly, so data on little endian (not network
     byte order) machines is correct so long as it has always remained
     on little endian machines).

     The bug corrupted data, resulting in any of these behaviors: the
     source and destination ports could be swapped, the service
     (web-side) port could be incorrect, the TCP flags could be
     incorrect, the packet and byte counts could be high (64 times
     higher than they should be), and the millisecond times could be
     wrong.
* Potential Incompatibilities
  -- When using SiLK flow records in contexts that do not use the
     millisecond field, truncate the millisecond value instead of
     rounding.
  -- rwbagcat, rwbagtool, rwcat: When file names are listed on the
     command line, do not attempt to read data from the standard input
     unless the user explicitly uses "stdin" as the name of an input
     file.  This change is required to allow the tools to work with
     cron(1).
  -- rwflowpack (sensor.conf): Allow a comma to occur between the IP
     addresses in an ipblock list.  This means that a comma cannot
     occur within the wildcard IP address, but it is believed few
     people were using this functionality.
  -- rwflowpack: minor log message changes; changed the log rotation
     hour to 00:00; modified the umask() of log files
* New feature: Address Type Plug-in (libaddrtype.so)
  -- Support for partitioning by or displaying the address type
     requires libaddrtype.so to exist in the $SILK_PATH/lib directory
     and the "address_types.pmap" file to exist in the
     $SILK_PATH/share/silk or $SILK_PATH/share directory.
  -- To create this binary "address_types.pmap" file, first list CIDR
     blocks in a text file (my-ips.txt) and label each as
     "non-routable", "internal" or "external" (any address that is not
     listed in the file is considered "external"), and then run the
     commands:

     rwpmapbuild -i my-ips.txt -o address_types.pmap

     For the best results with the pmap code, the CIDR blocks should
     be as large as possible.  One one to convert a list of IPs
     (ips.txt) into a list of large CIDR blocks (cidr.txt) is to run:

     rwsetbuild ips.txt stdout | rwsetcat --cidr > cidr.txt

  -- For more information, see the rwpmapbuild man page and the man
     pages of rwfilter, rwcut, rwsort, and rwuniq.
* New feature: Prefix Map Plug-in (libpmapfilter.so)
  -- Experimental creation and use of the user's own prefix maps
     (pmaps) for partitioning (rwfilter), sorting (rwsort), counting
     (rwuniq), and display (rwcut, rwuniq) is provided. The interface
     is still considered experimental and is subject to change.
  -- The rwpmapbuild tool reads a text file and builds a pmap file
     that can be used by the tools.  This file can relate IPs or
     Port/Protocol pairs to some attribute (this is how the country
     code and addrtype pmaps work).
  -- For details, see the rwpmapbuild and libpmapfilter man pages.
* New feature: Record Partitioning via IP-Port Pairs (libipport.so)
  -- The --ipport-any switch to rwfilter (provided by the libipport.so
     plug-in) will pass a record if its source IP and port or its
     destination IP and port are listed in the named text file.
  -- To use this plug-in, one creates a text file where each line
     contains a single IP address (either in dotted-decimal notation
     or as an integer), whitespace, and a list of ports of interest
     for that IP.  The port list can be a single number (80), a range
     of numbers ("6000-6100"), or comma-separated list of numbers and
     ranges ("6000-6100,80"). The file may also contain blank lines
     and comments; comments begin with the "#" character and continue
     to the end of the line.
  -- Support in rwfilter for partitioning records by IP-port pairs
     requires libipport.so to exist in the $SILK_PATH/lib directory.
* Improved sorting
  -- rwsort now supports getting fields from run-time plug-ins, like
     rwcut and rwuniq.
  -- When merging multiple temp-files, rwsort now attempts to open
     them all and merge them in one step, considerably reducing the
     I/O overhead of the merge sort.
* Better support for ICMP data
  -- rwfilter: new switches allow for filtering by the ICMP type and
     code (--icmp-type, --icmp-code)
  -- rwcut, rwsort, rwuniq: A new "icmpTypeCode" value to the --fields
     switch is allowed.  When this value is present, the ICMP type and
     code will be used as part of the key when sorting (rwsort) and
     counting (rwuniq), and it will be displayed (by rwcut and rwuniq)
     in separate columns labeled 'iType' and 'iCode' (which in
     columnar output will shorted to 'iTy' and 'iCo').  The
     --icmp-type-and-code switch on rwcut is still maintained for
     backwards compatibility, but its use is deprecated.
  -- rwstats: Supports using the ICMP type and code as a key with the
     --icmp switch.
* Configuration and Build System Changes
  -- In preparation of using the GNU Autotools, we've made major
     changes to build and configure system that bring us more in-line
     with the Autotools.  Note that the 'release', 'debug', and
     'profile' targets have gone away.  Use the --enable-debugging and
     --disable-optimization switches to configure for a fully
     debuggable binary.  See configure --help to see the full list of
     new options.
* Miscellaneous Improvements
  -- rwcount: Add a new value to the --load-scheme switch that will
     weigh the values assigned to each bin by the number of seconds
     the flow spent in the bin.
  -- rwfilter: new switch to filter on a negative next-hop IP
     (--not-next-hop-id)
  -- rwfilter: Filtering by IPsets is now supported directly in the
     application itself.  Previously, this was handled by a plug-in.
  -- flowcap: There is a new version of the flowcap file format, 5.
     Version 5 is identical to version 3, save for the fact that the
     input and output interface fields have been expanded to 16 bits.
  -- rwcut, rwsort, rwuniq: Provide numerical identifiers for fields
     (--fields switch) that hadn't had any previously.
* Bug fixes
  -- rwgroup: Fix several bugs, the majority of which have to do with
     the interaction between summarization and other actions.
  -- rwflowpack: Use fseeko() to fix an issue when writing large files
     on Solaris.
  -- rwfilter: Fix a crash that would occur when using a combination
     of the switches --dynamic-library --pass for certain dynamic
     libraries
  -- rwmatch: Several bug fixes.
  -- rwstats: Fix a bug that would cause rwstats to crash when
     attempting to compute the top-N when no records were read as
     input.
  -- rwtuc: Fix a bug that occurred when the user provided the
     --fields switch and a title line was present
  -- rwuniq: Fix a display bug by using the width of the value (versus
     the title) for setting width of columns that we get from
     plug-ins.
  -- rwuniq: Zero out the record prior to output to avoid getting
     random data values in the millisecond fields.  These random
     values were affecting the values in the time fields.
  -- libflowsource: Fix a bug that prevented it from building when
     used with certain parser generators.


SiLK-0.9.5 Release, 2006-May-08

* New packing support: flowcap
  -- The flowcap daemon allows the collection of flow data and the
     packing and storage of this flow data to occur on separate
     machines.
  -- To use flowcap, the LZO real-time data compression library must
     be installed. If configure does not find the LZO library, flowcap
     will not be built.
  -- Compilation and use of flowcap is optional.
* Improvements and significant changes to rwflowpack
  -- Splitting by IP address: Instead of using your router's SNMP
     interfaces to split traffic into inbound and outbound, rwflowpack
     can now split data by CIDR block.
  -- rwflowpack now requires configuration via a separate sensor.conf
     file.
  -- Many of rwflowpack's arguments have changed.
  -- rwflowpack's control script, rwfpd, has been split into two
     parts.
* New local timezone support: Pass the --enable-localtime switch to
  the configure script to use the local timezone in time input and
  output. Without this switch, the tools will use UTC. (Data files
  continue to be stored in UTC.)
* Format of printed timestamps has changed, the new format is
  2006/05/08T15:36:53.123. To enable the previous format by default,
  pass the --enable-legacy-timestamp switch to configure. The printed
  timestamp format can be set per invocation via the
  --legacy-timestamps switch.
* The tools that handle IPset files have been renamed. The old names
  are still supported for this release.
  -- rwsetbuild replaces buildset.
  -- rwsetcat replaces readset.
  -- rwsetintersect replaces setintersect.
  -- rwsetunion replaces rwset-union.
* New tool rwtuc: the text utility converter does the reverse of
  rwcut---it reads textual input and generates binary SiLK flow data
  from it.
* Manual pages are now included. Additional improvements to the
  documentation.
* Improvements to rwuniq
  -- Supports computing counts of unique source or destination IPs for
     small input sets; the memory requirements to support these counts
     can grow quickly.
  -- Can be used with run-time plug-ins.
* Improvements to rwbagtool: Less memory is used during merging of
  multiple Bag files, and some recursive routines have been rewritten
  to reduce memory and increase speed.
* Changes to rwsetcat and rwbagcat: The output of the
  --network-structure switch has changed.
* For tools that produce textual output, columnar output and column
  separator can be controlled separately. These tools all support the
  --delimited switch; the former --delimiter switch which some tools
  supported is deprecated.
* Improvements to rwappend: Now supports "appending" to a nonexistent
  file. Restrictions on the types of files that rwappend supported
  have been removed.
* Configuration for multiple sites is easier, though the choice of
  which site to build for must still be made when you run the
  configure script.
* Significant rearrangement of the source code tree.
