 *    The silk_config2.h file is the second of two header files
 *    generated when you run configure.  The first is silk_config.h,
 *    which will #include this file.
 *
 *    The template file silk_config1.h.in is created by autoheader.
 *    When you run configure, a silk_config1.h file is created, and
 *    then all values in that file are prefixed by "SK_" and the
 *    result is written to silk_config.h.  The silk_config1.h file is
 *    only used to create silk_config.h.
 *
 *    The template file silk_config2.h.in is maintained manually.
 *    silk_config2.h contains values that the system headers
 *    use/require, and as such they should NOT be prefixed with "SK_"
