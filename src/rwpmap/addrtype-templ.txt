## Required Setup ######################################################

# Note: The addrtype library code assumes the following definitions of
# label IDs 0, 1, and 2 as defined below.

#    Numerical mappings of labels

label 0             non-routable
label 1             internal
label 2             external

#    Default to "external" for all un-defined ranges.

default             external

#    Force IP-based mode

mode                ip

## Reserved and non-routable blocks ####################################

#    Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
#    network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
#    host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
#    refer to specified hosts on this network [RFC1700, page 4].

0.0.0.0/8           non-routable

#    This block is set aside for use in private networks.
#    Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
#    block should not appear on the public Internet.

10.0.0.0/8          non-routable

#    This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
#    loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher level protocol to an
#    address anywhere within this block should loop back inside the host.
#    This is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback,
#    but no addresses within this block should ever appear on any network
#    anywhere [RFC1700, page 5].

127.0.0.0/8         non-routable

#    This is the "link local" block.  It is allocated for
#    communication between hosts on a single link.  Hosts obtain these
#    addresses by auto-configuration, such as when a DHCP server may not
#    be found.

169.254.0.0/16      non-routable

#    This block is set aside for use in private networks.
#    Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
#    block should not appear on the public Internet.

172.16.0.0/12       non-routable

#    This block is assigned as "TEST-NET" for use in
#    documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
#    domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
#    documentation.  Addresses within this block should not appear on the
#    public Internet.

192.0.2.0/24        non-routable

#    This block is set aside for use in private networks.
#    Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
#    block should not appear on the public Internet.

192.168.0.0/16      non-routable

#    240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
#    space, is reserved.  The "limited broadcast" destination address
#    255.255.255.255 should never be forwarded outside the (sub-)net of
#    the source.  The remainder of this space is reserved for future use.
#    [RFC1700, page 4]

255.255.255.255/32  non-routable

## Instructions ########################################################

# See the addrtype(3) man page for the details, but for the impatient:
# Add your local address space to end of this file by adding lines of
# the form
#
#CIDR  internal
#
# for example
#
##Carnegie Mellon
#128.2.0.0/16  internal
#
# Generate the binary address_types.pmap file using:
#
#   rwpmapbuild -input <this file> -output address_types.pmap
#
# and move address_types.pmap into $SILK_PATH/share/silk/
