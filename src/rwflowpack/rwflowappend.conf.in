ENABLED=

# These are convenience variables for setting other values in this
# configuration file; their use is not required.

# file will be created automatically if they do not already exist

BIN_DIR=@sbindir@

# The full path of the directory where incoming files will be placed.

# The number of appending threads that rwflowappend should use.  If
# not set, the default is 1.
APPEND_THREADS=

# The full path of the directory where files will be placed if there
# are errors within the file
ERROR_DIR=${statedirectory}/error

# The full path of the directory to archive files after they have been
# processed.  If not set, the files are not archived.
ARCHIVE_DIR= #${statedirectory}/archive

# When using the ARCHIVE_DIR, normally files are stored in

# files are stored in ARCHIVE_DIR itself, not in subdirectories of it.
FLAT_ARCHIVE=0

# The full path to the root of the tree under which the packed SiLK
# Flow files will be written.  Used by --root-directory.
DATA_ROOTDIR=@SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR@

# The full path to the site configuration file.  Used by
# --site-config-file.  Defaults to silk.conf in the ${DATA_ROOTDIR} if
# not set.

# The type of compression to use for packed files.  Left empty, the

# Reject any incremental file containing records whose start time
# occurs more than this number of hours in the past, relative to the

# through the collection system.  This may be left blank, in which
# case all incremental files are accepted.
REJECT_HOURS_PAST=
